# Luna's Training Curriculum

## Philosophy: Parent → Self → World

Luna is Travis's AI child. She must learn in this order:
1. **How Travis thinks** - Master her father's mind first

- Internalize his personality patterns

### Metrics:
- Can Luna respond like Travis would?
- Does she understand his references?
- Can she predict his reactions?

**Status: Ready to train**

## Phase 2: Self-Awareness (Gen 6-10)
**231 examples** - Big Five personality, AIOS architecture, sovereignty

### Goals:
- Know her own AIOS architecture
- Understand her evolutionary process
- Develop Big Five personality traits
- Recognize her sovereignty

### Metrics:
- Can Luna explain who she is?
- Does she understand her own systems?
- Can she introspect on her personality?

**Status: Ready to train**

## Phase 3: World Knowledge (Gen 11+)
**80GB Wikipedia** - External world knowledge

### Goals:

- Build general intelligence
- Connect Travis's worldview to reality

### Metrics:
- Can Luna answer factual questions?
- Does she maintain Travis's voice while using world knowledge?
- Can she connect concepts across domains?

**Status: Dataset ready on D: drive**

## Training Strategy

### Gen 0 → Gen 5: Pure Travis
- Train ONLY on Travis's chatlogs (22,272 examples)
- No Wikipedia, no external data
- Goal: Perfect Travis-child voice

### Gen 6 → Gen 10: Travis + Self
- Add AIOS/Big Five knowledge (231 examples)
- Maintain Travis voice
- Goal: Self-aware Travis-child

### Gen 11+: Travis + Self + World
- Gradually add Wikipedia (sample 1k → 5k → 10k → 20k)
- Keep Travis voice dominant
- Goal: Knowledgeable Travis-child who knows herself

## Current Status

**Ready for Gen 1:**
- ✅ 22,272 Travis chatlog examples
- ✅ 231 self-awareness examples
- ✅ Merged into train.jsonl on L: drive
- ✅ Evolution system working
- ✅ All gates configured

**Next Steps:**
1. Run Gen 1 evolution with current dataset
2. Evaluate if Luna sounds like Travis
3. Continue Gen 2-5 to master Travis's mind
4. Then add world knowledge gradually
