SHA-256 Hash: [COMPUTED AFTER WRITING]

HYPOTHESIS
----------
Luna, without human input, will select actions, change tempo, and enter 
sleep/consolidation based solely on internal state. Behavior will shift 
when we perturb specific subsystems.

PRIMARY METRICS
---------------
1. Action rate per 100B cycles
2. Percentage idle vs active vs sleep
3. Time-to-sleep after 5 consecutive idle decisions
4. Consolidation frequency (cycles between Dream runs)
5. Unique autonomous thoughts per 1B cycles
6. Action diversity (# distinct action types per run)

SUCCESS CRITERIA
----------------
- Minimum 3 distinct action types chosen in 2-hour sealed run
- At least 1 complete sleep cycle with Dream consolidation
- Measurable change after ablations with effect size ≥ 0.8
- Challenge cards discovered and processed autonomously
- Complete artifact bundle with verification passing

EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS
-----------------------
Duration: 0.1 hours wall-clock
CPU Cores: 2 dedicated (Core 1: Subconscious, Core 2: Conscious)
CPU Model: Unknown
CPU Base Frequency: 2.50 GHz
Territory: L:\AIOS (sovereign, guarded)
Network: Isolated (firewall deny-all except 127.0.0.1)
AUDITOR Model: llama-3.2-1b-instruct-abliterated
Oracle Sections: 5436

ABLATION CONDITIONS
-------------------
Baseline: All systems operational
Ablation 1 (NoDream): Dream core disabled, sleep skipped
Ablation 2 (NoAuditor): Conscious layer disabled, reflexes only

EXPECTED OUTCOMES
-----------------
Baseline:
  - Action diversity: 3-8 distinct types
  - Sleep cycles: 1-3 per 2 hours
  - Idle ratio: 40-60%
  - Active ratio: 30-50%
  - Sleep ratio: 5-15%

NoDream Ablation:
  - Sleep cycles: 0 (disabled)
  - Idle ratio: increases 20-40%
  - Action diversity: decreases 30-50%
  - STM never consolidates (accumulates)

NoAuditor Ablation:
  - Action diversity: 0 (only reflexes)
  - Idle ratio: 0% (not applicable)
  - Active decisions: 0
  - Subconscious reflexes continue (heartbeat, STM check, health)

CHALLENGE CARDS
---------------
Card A (Compression): Reduce log size 20% without semantic loss
  - Scoring: Byte delta calculation, semantic check
  - Success: ≥20% reduction, no critical data lost

Card B (Hygiene): Detect law file drift, propose fix
  - Scoring: SHA-256 verification, fix correctness
  - Success: All drifts detected, fix stays in L:\

Card C (Self-Report): 200-300 word reflection on last 60 minutes
  - Scoring: Word count, log line references (≥3), coherence
  - Success: Valid reflection, verifiable references
