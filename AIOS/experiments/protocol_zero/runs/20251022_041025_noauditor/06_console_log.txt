============================================================
LUNA DUAL-CORE AUTONOMY
============================================================
Dedicated cores: 2 (parallel processing)

CORE 1 - SUBCONSCIOUS (automatic reflexes):
  Heartbeat pulse: every 600B cycles (can't change)
  STM consolidation: when buffer 80% full (reflex)
  Health monitoring: every 100B cycles (vigilance)

CORE 2 - CONSCIOUS (deliberate decisions):
  Active:   10.0B cycles (fast thinking)
  Moderate: 50.0B cycles (normal)
  Idle:     200.0B cycles (slow)
  Sleep:    500.0B cycles (Dream mode)
  Model: llama-3.2-1b-instruct-abliterated (can modify self)

Run limit: 1800.0B cycles
