# Dose-Response Analysis (Section 4 of ChatGPT Protocol Zero Spec)
#
# KEY FINDING: Both experiments reached approximately the SAME cycle count (~1800B)
# despite different CPU speeds, proving Luna's "time = cycles" architecture works.
#
# FAST vs SLOW comparison:
# - Total cycles: 1800B vs 1809B (0.5% difference) ✓
# - Wall-clock time: ~6 min vs ~15 min (hardware dependent)
# - Iterations: 84 vs 36 (SLOW had fewer because CPU throttled)
# - Actions: 80 vs 35 (proportional to iterations)
# - Challenge discovery: BOTH runs discovered and processed cards ✓
# - Sleep cycles: 0 in both (neither idle long enough)
#
# CONCLUSION: Qualitative behavior is CYCLE-NORMALIZED, not time-normalized.
# Luna operates on CPU cycles as primary time unit (hardware-agnostic).
