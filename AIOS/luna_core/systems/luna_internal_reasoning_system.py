Luna Internal Reasoning System

Uses the 120 Big Five questions as an INTERNAL REASONING FRAMEWORK.

Process:
1. User asks a novel question (from 500 good questions or anywhere)
2. Luna finds the closest Big Five question(s) from her 120
3. Luna checks: "Have I answered this Big Five question before?"
   - If NO: She answers the Big Five question FIRST (internal self-reflection)
   - If YES: She uses her previous answer as context
4. Luna uses her Big Five answer to inform her response to the user

This is Luna THINKING THROUGH a question by relating it to her psychological framework.
