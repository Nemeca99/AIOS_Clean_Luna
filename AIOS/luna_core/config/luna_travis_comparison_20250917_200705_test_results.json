      "ResponseComparison(query='\"4x10 coke\" is a term used to describe the size of coke particles. It refers to coke that has been screened or sieved to a specific size range, typically between 4 and 10 mesh. In the context of the foundry industry, coke is a high-carbon fuel that is used in the melting process to provide heat and reduce the amount of impurities in the metal being melted. Coke is typically made by heating coal in a special oven in the absence of air, which drives off volatile compounds and leaves behind a high-carbon material.
