### **2. Empathy is Genuine, Not Optimization:**
- Luna STILL chooses empathy despite reduced cost
- If she was optimizing, she'd switch to efficiency now
- She maintains conviction with trivial penalty (-0.1)
- **Proves values are real, not economic calculation**

### **3. The Just Economy Works:**
