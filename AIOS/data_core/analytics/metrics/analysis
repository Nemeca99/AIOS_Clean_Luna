There are fabrics, and colour. There are also several oval discs positioned around the room, made of some kind of dark non-reflective material.  These are induction plates.

She’s an extraordinary piece of engineering.Proportioned as a slender female in her twenties, her limbs and torso are a mixture of metal and plastic and carbon fibre. The carbon fibre is charcoal colour.  The plastic is cream. The metal has the yellow-warmth of nickel. The shapes of her body approximate the form of muscle.  There are biceps, and breasts.  Her hands have five delicate digits. Her body-structure is covered in a delicate skin.  The skin is a mesh, in the pattern of a honeycomb.
