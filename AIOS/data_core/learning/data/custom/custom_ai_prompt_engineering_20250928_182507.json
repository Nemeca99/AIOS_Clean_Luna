  "content": "\n        AI Prompt Engineering is the art and science of crafting effective instructions for AI models.\n        \n        Key principles:\n        - Be specific and clear in your instructions\n        - Provide context when necessary\n        - Use examples to guide the AI's output\n        - Test and iterate on your prompts\n        \n        A good prompt structure includes:\n        1. Context: Background information\n        2. Instruction: What you want the AI to do\n        3. Example: Sample of desired output\n        \n        This helps the AI understand exactly what you need and produce better results.\n        ",
