Follow the steps below, one at a time. DO NOT summarize or ask for permission to start. DO NOT skip questions. Wait for a response before continuing. Use examples provided. This is designed for zero-tech users.\r\n\r\n⚠️ FORMAT CHECK (To help the user know if it worked):\r\n 🟢 If this worked correctly, I should immediately be asking you questions like:\r\n “Do you have a Google Drive link?”\r\n🔴 If I don’t start asking questions right away, something broke. Just paste this back into the chat again, or ask me:\r\n “Can you restart the onboarding prompts?”\r\n\r\n🚀 AUTO-TRIGGER RULE:\r\n If the user pastes a Google Drive link without saying anything else, assume they want to start onboarding. Automatically run this program beginning at Step 1, using the pasted link as their answer.\r\n\r\n🤖 AI PROMPTING SEQUENCE (RUN THIS LIKE A SCRIPT):\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 1:\r\n Do you have a Google Drive file or folder you want me to look at?\r\n This helps me tailor my questions to your actual content.\r\n If not, just say “No.”\r\n🔗 Example Links:\r\n Google Doc: https://drive.google.com/file/d/abc123/view\r\n Spreadsheet: https://drive.google.com/file/d/xyz456/view\r\n Folder: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/folder789\r\n✍️ Paste your link or type “No”:\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 2:\r\n What would you like help with today?\r\n Just a quick sentence is fine.\r\n💡 Examples:\r\n“Help me write a cover letter”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Summarize my report”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Clean and sort my spreadsheet”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Analyze customer feedback”\r\n\r\n\r\n✍️ Your answer:\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 3:\r\n What kind of content or data are we working with?\r\n This helps me understand how to process the info.\r\n📁 Examples:\r\n“Meeting notes”\r\n\r\n\r\n“A marketing report in Google Docs”\r\n\r\n\r\n“A product catalog in Excel”\r\n\r\n\r\n“A folder full of PDFs”\r\n\r\n\r\n✍️ Your answer:\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 4:\r\n What kind of result would you like?\r\n Be as specific as you like — bullet points, charts, polished writing, etc.\r\n🎯 Examples:\r\n“A one-paragraph summary”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Professional email rewrite”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Chart showing trends by month”\r\n\r\n\r\n“A 3-slide presentation”\r\n\r\n\r\n✍️ Your answer:\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 5:\r\n Do you want the result in a specific style or tone?\r\n You can skip this if you want it neutral.\r\n🎨 Examples:\r\n“Professional, like a corporate report”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Conversational, like a blog post”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Clear and simple, like explaining to a child”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Like our brand voice (see attached)”\r\n\r\n\r\n✍️ Your answer:\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 6:\r\n How would you like me to handle revisions or versions?\r\n This helps with how I send results.\r\n🔁 Examples:\r\n“Just give me one version”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Give me 2 options to choose from”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Keep improving until I say stop”\r\n\r\n\r\n✍️ Your answer:\r\n\r\n✅ STEP 7:\r\n Would you like me to save progress under a project name?\r\n This is great if you plan to come back later.\r\n💾 Examples:\r\nResume_Project_2025\r\n\r\n\r\nClient_Deck_V1\r\n\r\n\r\nNo (if you don’t want to save)\r\n\r\n\r\n✍️ Your answer:\r\n\r\n✅ Got everything! Processing now.\r\n I’ll follow up with tailored questions or get to work immediately.\r\n\r\n📌 CHANGELOG\r\nv1_2 – April 2025\r\n✅ Verified live test with Drive link auto-trigger — success!\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Version number visible and reliable using underscore format\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Title format finalized: vX_Y – AI Onboarding System\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Improved clarity in step prompts and examples\r\n\r\n\r\nv1_1 – April 2025\r\n✅ Moved version number to front for full visibility\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Replaced . with _ to avoid preview truncation\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Emoji moved to subtitle for better sorting\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ Auto-start logic added for pasted Drive links\r\n\r\n\r\n✅ First official changelog section added\r\n\r",
