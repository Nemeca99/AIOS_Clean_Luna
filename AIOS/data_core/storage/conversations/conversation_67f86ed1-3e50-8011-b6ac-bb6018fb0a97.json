I’m here to help you with your task. To get started, I need you to provide me with a **Google Drive link** that contains the information you’d like assistance with.\n\nPlease share one of the following types of links:\n\n- **Google Document**: [Link to your Google Doc]\n- **Google Spreadsheet**: [Link to your Google Sheet]\n- **Google Folder**: [Link to your Google Drive Folder]\n\nOnce I have the link, I’ll guide you through the next steps and tailor the process to your specific needs. If you're ready, please paste your link below, and we’ll get started!\n\n---\n\n### **How This Works:**\n1. The user pastes the Google Drive link.\n2. The AI will use the link to follow the onboarding instructions from your Google Docs or Sheets.\n3. The AI will then ask for further input and provide structured assistance based on the document contents.\n\n---\n\nThis \"start prompt\" is universal because it prepares the AI to first ask for a **Google Drive link**, and once that’s shared, the system can be tailored to guide the user through the process. It’s simple and ready to go.\n\n---\n\n### **Why this works**:\n- **Universal**: Doesn’t matter what document type (Google Docs, Sheets, or Folders) the user provides — the AI can handle it.\n- **Modular**: The AI knows to first gather the link and then continue the flow based on the instructions in the document.\n\n---\n\nThis approach removes the need for extra technical details and helps streamline the process!

      "content": "It’s great that you’re still pushing forward! It sounds like you’ve put a lot of time and effort into making this work, and you're close to something really powerful. I totally get that you're trying to **remove any friction** and make it so that anyone — without any extra steps or tech — can run the onboarding system **directly from any AI chat interface**.\n\nYou’re thinking of a **plug-and-play solution** that can work for anyone, even without the Plus version, and without needing to copy-paste instructions every time. I get the vision, and that’s ambitious! Let’s brainstorm some more targeted solutions:\n\n### Key Challenge\n- **Free AI versions** don’t have a native ability to execute scripts based on just a link.\n- But you want users to simply **paste a Google link** and have the system automatically run **without needing extra effort or permissions**.\n\n---\n\n### **My Suggestions to Tackle This Challenge**:\n\n#### **Solution 1: \"One-Step Command\" System Using Web-Based Integrations**  \nHere’s an idea that still keeps things simple, yet more **fully automated**:\n\n1. **Create a Custom Web Application** (No-Code/Low-Code Approach) that acts as a front end.  \n   - The user pastes the **Google Drive link** into a simple web form. \n   - Once the link is submitted, it will **automatically fetch the Google Doc’s content** via Google Docs API (or Google Apps Script) and run the onboarding system.\n   - The user doesn’t have to interact with AI directly; they can simply paste the link, and the web tool **pushes the results** to them in an intuitive interface, or integrates with a messaging platform (such as Slack or a chatbot interface).\n\n   **What you need**:\n   - A **Google Apps Script** or **Zapier** workflow that pulls the content from a Google Doc.\n   - A **no-code website builder** (like Wix, Webflow, or Bubble) that integrates the script and sends feedback to the user.\n\n   **Benefit**: Completely automated, frictionless — just one step: paste a link.\n\n#### **Solution 2: Use AI that Supports More Robust Automation**  \nSome AI systems (beyond just ChatGPT) allow for **custom integrations** via APIs, and they let you **automate** based on link inputs. For example:\n\n- **Rasa** or **Botpress**: Both are open-source chatbot platforms that let you create custom **AI workflows**.\n- **Zapier** + **Chatbots**: Zapier has integrations that allow you to create workflows (like extracting information from Google Docs) and trigger an action based on that link input.\n\nYou could build a **custom chatbot on these platforms** that works like your vision, where a user pastes a Google Doc link, and the chatbot:\n1. Reads the document (using a Google API).\n2. Runs the onboarding process.\n3. Provides tailored results based on user input.\n\n**What you need**:\n- Time to build or implement a chatbot on these platforms.\n- **API access** to pull content from Google Docs.\n\n#### **Solution 3: Exploring Third-Party AI that Supports Link-Based Interactions**  \nSome **advanced AI** platforms (still under the experimental phase) allow link-based **custom instructions**:\n- **OpenAI’s GPT** (through API) might allow for deeper integrations where you provide a Google Docs link to a **backend system**, and the backend AI reads, processes, and runs it.\n\nYou’d likely need to use a **server-side implementation**, but it could be something like:\n1. The user sends a Google link to your platform.\n2. Your server (or AI backend) fetches the Google Doc, parses it, and processes it.\n3. **Automatically** starts guiding the user without them needing to input anything into the chat itself.\n\n### **What I Can Do for You Next**\nIf you want to keep pushing forward on this, I'd be glad to:\n1. Help you write up the **Google Apps Script** (for Docs) to pull the onboarding content, or guide you through the **no-code chatbot** approach.\n2. Provide you with **steps for integrating** this into a web platform.\n3. Discuss the more technical side of getting an **AI chatbot** with your specs (where you can paste the Google Doc link and run the program seamlessly).\n\n---\n\nFeel free to share your next steps or where you'd like to go, and I can keep helping you make that vision happen! You’ve been doing some incredible work so far, and I’m confident you’re really close to a breakthrough. 💡",

      "content": "I totally get it — you want to create a **seamless, no-hassle experience** where anyone can use the onboarding system without needing a **ChatGPT Plus** subscription. While the free version of ChatGPT doesn’t allow you to automate scripts directly (or create persistent custom GPTs), there are still ways to make the process as smooth as possible for users without requiring any technical setup or payment.\n\nHere are a couple of ideas that will allow **anyone** to use your onboarding system easily, **without the need for Plus**:\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 1: Use Google Docs as a \"Self-Running\" Script**\n\nIf you want users to run it without any special tools or AI model, here's a **Google Docs solution**:\n\n1. **Create a \"template\" document** (like the one you already have).\n2. Add **detailed instructions** directly into that document, guiding users step-by-step. For example, you can include instructions like:\n\n---\n\n### Example Onboarding Google Doc:\n\n```\n# AI Onboarding System v1_2\n\nTo get started, follow these instructions:\n\n1. **Do you have a Google Drive file or folder to share?**\n   - Paste your Google Drive link below.\n\n2. **What would you like help with today?**\n   - Provide a quick summary of what you need help with.\n\n3. **What kind of content are we working with?**\n   - Describe the type of file(s) you're working with (e.g., document, spreadsheet).\n\n4. **What kind of result are you looking for?**\n   - Specify if you'd like a summary, analysis, or a more complex output.\n\n5. **How would you like the result to be formatted?**\n   - Choose if you want it in bullet points, a report, etc.\n\n6. **Would you like to save your progress under a project name?**\n   - Example: \"Project_April2025\"\n\nSimply answer these questions in the document, and the system will help guide you from there!\n```\n\n---\n\n### **How It Works**:\n1. You **share the Google Doc link** with users.\n2. They follow the **step-by-step instructions** inside the document, entering their own responses.\n3. If they need **AI assistance**, they can copy/paste their responses into ChatGPT (free version) for each step.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 2: Use a \"Script-Driven\" Web Interface (No Code, Free Tools)**\n\nIf you want a **more automated, smooth process** for people to use it without ChatGPT Plus, you can use **no-code tools** to build a simple interface that will automatically guide users. Here's how:\n\n1. **Google Forms + Google Sheets**:\n   - **Google Forms**: Create a form that asks users the same onboarding questions (similar to the steps in your document).\n   - **Google Sheets**: Use a **Google Sheets integration** to process their responses.\n   - **Automated Email Response**: Once the form is filled, it can send them a tailored email or even a Google Doc with their results.\n\n---\n\n### **Solution 3: Embed Onboarding in a Chatbot (No Code)**\n\nFor a **fully automated experience**, you could embed a simple chatbot on your website that interacts with users and asks the questions without needing ChatGPT Plus. You can use **no-code chatbot builders** like:\n\n- **Tars**\n- **Landbot**\n- **Chatfuel**\n\nThese platforms allow you to create **interactive, script-based** chatbots that can collect user input, process responses, and provide results — all for **free**.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile **ChatGPT Plus** offers the best way to streamline the process with persistent, custom GPTs, you can still make the onboarding system work **for free** by:\n- Leveraging Google Docs as a “self-running” system with detailed instructions.\n- Using no-code tools to create a more automated chatbot or interface.\n  \nWould you like help setting up either of these solutions?

The onboarding instructions inside the doc will kick off the program.\n\nWould you like me to preview how the Doc looks to a user, or help you improve the wording inside that doc to make it trigger more smoothly?",

And it should **automatically run the onboarding process** — without needing to copy/paste the program every time.\n\n---\n\n### ❗ The Catch:\nRight now, **AI models (like free ChatGPT)** don't automatically run scripts *just from a link* unless the onboarding program is already active in that chat. They need to be \"primed\" — meaning the AI needs to have seen the instructions (your v1_2 script) first.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Solution: Bundle the instructions with the link\n\nHere’s what to share with users so it works reliably in **any AI or free ChatGPT**:\n\n---\n\n### **SHARE THIS WITH YOUR USERS**:\n\n```\nHey!

ChatGPT (via OpenAI API) on a Website**\n- Use this onboarding script as the *\"system prompt\"* for a custom AI assistant.\n- Embed the assistant on your site using tools like:\n  - **ChatGPT GPTs + Share Link Embed**\n  - **OpenAI API + JavaScript UI (custom chat box)**\n- Any user interaction kicks off the onboarding process, especially if they paste a Drive link.\n\n#### **2. Google Vertex AI + Gemini Chatbot**\n- If the company uses **Google Cloud**, you can deploy this in a Gemini-powered chat app.\n- Easily integrates with existing GDrive permissions and user access.\n- Gemini is *extremely good* with Google Docs/Sheets natively.\n\n#### **3. No-Code Platforms (like Intercom, Drift, or Botpress)**\n- These let you use a **GPT-based backend** and plug in your onboarding script.\n- Works great for customer portals, B2B intake forms, client onboarding, etc.\n- You can even attach form logic (e.g., collect Step 2 input, tag it, etc.)\n\n---\n\n### 🧠 **Why this template is ideal:**\n- Fully **AI-readable** and human-friendly.\n- Designed for **zero-tech end users**.\n- Uses **universal instructions**, so it’ll work across OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, etc.\n- Follows **step-by-step flow**, making it easy to map into chatbot workflows or UI steps.\n\n---\n\n### 🔧 Want help building it?\nI can:\n- Generate the **HTML/JS code** for embedding it into a site.\n- Format it as a **Gemini app** for Google Cloud users.\n- Create a **public version** branded for your company with usage instructions.\n\nJust tell me what route you (or your client) are thinking, and I’ll generate the setup!",
