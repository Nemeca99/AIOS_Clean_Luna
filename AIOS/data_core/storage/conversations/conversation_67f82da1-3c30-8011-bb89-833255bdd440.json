We\u2019ll walk through everything step by step. You don\u2019t need to worry about technical details \u2014 just answer the questions as best you can.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udcc2 Step 1: Do you already have a dataset or document you want to work with?\n\nIf YES:\n- Paste the **Google Drive link** to your dataset or document here:\n- Make sure it is set to **\"Anyone with the link can view\"** so the AI can access it.\n- Example: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/abc123XYZ/view?usp=sharing`\n\nIf NO:\n- That\u2019s totally fine! We\u2019ll help you build or gather your content from scratch.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 *Once you paste the link, the AI will scan it and ask follow-up questions based on what it finds to tailor the system for you.*\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want this embedded as a formal markdown block, Google Doc, PDF, or any other format for distribution. I can also add support sections like \"Troubleshooting Access\" or \"What\u2019s a Google Drive link?\" if you're aiming for full accessibility.",

Here are a few streamlined approaches you could incorporate to make your onboarding \u201cprogram\u201d work seamlessly with Google Drive or similar platforms:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Options for Google Drive Integration**\n\n#### 1. **Manual Import (for simplicity or MVP)**\nProvide users a simple step:\n> \"Paste the link to your shared Google Drive folder or file here.\"\n\nThen you program the AI to say:\n> \u201cThanks. I\u2019ve accessed the dataset. Beginning analysis.\u201d\n\n\u2705 *Pros:* Easy, no dev work.\n\u274c *Cons:* Requires user interaction every time.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Google Drive API Integration**\nFor full automation:\n- Authenticate the user via OAuth2.\n- Use the Google Drive API to list and fetch files programmatically.\n- Connect this to your onboarding logic, so it pulls the latest dataset automatically on session start.\n\n\u2705 *Pros:* Seamless experience, version control, auto-loading.\n\u274c *Cons:* Requires coding a backend (Node.js, Python Flask/FastAPI, etc.).\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Google Apps Script Add-on (Google-native tool)**\nYou can create a sidebar/menu inside Docs/Sheets:\n- \u201cSend to Onboarding AI\u201d\n- It packages the doc and sends a POST request to your AI endpoint.\n\n\u2705 *Pros:* Google-native feel, great for corporate users.\n\u274c *Cons:* Requires setup per company/user.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. **Scheduled Sync**\nLet users link a shared folder and set a sync schedule (e.g., \u201cCheck every 6 hours\u201d or \u201cpull latest version if timestamp changes\u201d).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 How You Could Describe This in the Save File Template:\n\n```markdown\n\ud83d\udcbc [Enterprise Config]\n- External Dataset Location: [Google Drive URL or API token]\n- Sync Method: [Manual Input | API Integration | Apps Script Add-on | Scheduled Sync]\n- Access Protocol: [OAuth2.0 | Shared Public Link | API Key]\n- Fallback: Request user upload if Drive access fails\n```\n\n---\n\nWant help setting up a mockup of any of those options\u2014or embedding the Drive options directly into your save file template logic?",

While you *can't* directly connect this \u201cprogram\u201d (running inside ChatGPT) to your Google Drive in real time, there are a few ways to **simulate that kind of access** and make the workflow seamless:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 BEST OPTIONS TO LINK TO GOOGLE DRIVE\n\n#### **Option 1: Share a Public or Editable Google Docs Link**\n- Just upload your dataset (e.g. full Save File, master character sheet, full novel draft, etc.) to Google Docs.\n- Set the sharing to **\u201cAnyone with the link can view\u201d** *(or edit, if you want me to save stuff back)*.\n- Then paste the link here and say something like:\n\n> \u201cTreat this doc as my master file for X. I\u2019ll refer to it by name going forward.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ll then use it as an external reference and even simulate edits or merges into it if needed.\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 2: Use Google Drive as a File Drop for Uploads**\nIf your dataset is too big or structured oddly (CSV, JSON, multiple docs), you can:\n1. Download the files from Drive as `.zip` or raw files.\n2. Upload them directly to me here (drag-and-drop).\n3. I\u2019ll parse and load everything internally, then let you refer to it by a nickname (e.g. \u201cmy dataset\u201d).\n\n---\n\n#### **Option 3: Sync Workflow with a Manual Refresh Command**\nIf you\u2019re okay doing a little manual step, you can:\n- Keep editing your docs on Drive.\n- Just say something like:\n\n> \u201cRefresh my dataset from [link] \u2014 this is the latest version.\u201d\n\nThat tells me to re-ingest the latest version and discard the old one from memory.\n\n---\n\nWould you like to test this by linking me your current Save File or novel draft in Google Docs? I can walk you through exactly how to sync it and set a nickname like `@savefile.v2`.",

Before proceeding:\n\n> \ud83d\udd39 Would you like me to treat this as:\n> 1. A **new version** of the same chapter?\n> 2. A **separate draft or experimental rewrite**?\n> 3.

      "content": "The office was quiet as it was nearing the end of the day, the clock on the wall as Anya walks past it showing 5:05pm. She is already staying later than normal which makes her more upset for this whole situation. Nervously, she shifts from foot to foot as her heels, heavy with clicking on the tile floor, approaches Brynn\u2019s office. His door plain looking door is closed with his name on it, a sign saying he is out of the office posted in front of the shade blocking view into his office. Standing in front of his door, small bits of light poke through the shade to indicate he is still here. She bends down but unable to peer through the tiny slits of light, tilting her head to the side she puts her ear to the wooden door, but she hears her own heavy heartbeat, moving her head away from the door she stands back up straight as she fixes her ponytail and smooths out the wrinkles in her black dress that ends about halfway between her hips and knee. Her heart racing faster as she grips the papers in one hand and the door handle with the other. \u201cYou got this.\u201d She thinks to herself, palms sweaty as she turns the handle, opening the door slowly. Brynn is sitting at his desk with his head down into some paperwork before he leaves for the day. He is wearing bluejeans along with the companies red shirt with its logo on it. His brown leather jacket hangs on the hook along the wall behind him, his computer monitor turned off with a silly sign over it that says, \u201cThe files are in the computer?\u201d in reference to the movie Zoolander, along with the image of the scene to match. She steps inside his office closing the door behind her carefully, his attention elsewhere as he doesn\u2019t hear or see her come in and is startled when she slams the pile of papers on his desk over his own. Anya sees the sign over the monitor as she scoffs at such a childish movie, \u201cSeems about right for him.\u201d she mutters to herself as Brynn looks up to see Anya standing over him with her arms crossed. Brynn\u2019s face with some confusion as she slams the papers in her hand onto the desk in front of him, taken back slightly he looks down at them and then back to her. \n\n\n\n\u201cHello to you to Anya.\u201d Brynn\u2019s eyes look at the papers, leaning back to where he was before he picks up the papers giving them a read before a grin begins to form across his lips, lowering the papers to show her. Anya\u2019s eye twitches as he swears he can see steam coming from her ears and nose. Anya sighs as she speaks with an almost defeated tone but soon turns to annoyance and frustration as her face almost contorts while speaking, \u201cLook, I am not happy about this\u2026this\u2026this\u2026. ugh!\u201d uncrossing her arms emoting with them, flailing them up and down as she stutters, trying to keep her anger under control. Her ponytail whipping around over her shoulders with her head shaking side to side to comprehend what is going on as she speaks, adding to the anger on her face. Slumping her shoulders down, her arms relax to her sides before she makes fists, they shake slightly as he can see the anger inside her. Taking a deep breath, she looks at him with her eyes slowly opening, raising on hand she points directly at him with one finger and then aggressively taps that finger on the papers on his desk. Brynn\u2019s smile never changing as he remarks, \u201cI don\u2019t snore much anymore.\u201d raising his own shoulders in response, the look on his face one of not caring. He knows this isn\u2019t what she is upset about. It is about the fact they have to share a room. Her eyes widen as they pierce right through him, leaning forwards on the desk as she slams her fists down onto the table causing Brynn to jump back in his chair slightly. Leaning closer to him her, Brynn\u2019s eyes dart down for a second down her cleavage to see a dim red fabric in the shadows. Her own eyes look down before she stands back up again, crossing her arms across her chest she gives him an evil look. \u201cFucking pervert.\u201d Muttering under her breath before rubbing her temples with some of her fingers. Her lips move slowly and with precision, \u201cYou know EXACTLY why I am upset. This fucking company is too cheap to get us separate rooms for this little event they want us to do.\u201d \n\n\n\nHe tries to open his mouth, but she quickly stands up straight as she sticks her hand up palm towards him. She interjects, \u201cYes, I did talk to Brad. You know what he said?\u201d the tone in her voice rises as her face turns more and more red, her arms crossing again as she turns sideways slightly. Her eyes close slightly, Brynn\u2019s eyes meanwhile follow down her dress to her ass that the dress isn\u2019t hiding. She speaks using a mocking tone in reference to Brad\u2019s voice and tone, \u201cWell you two are adults, ha-ha.\u201d she then opens her eyes to see Brynn looking at her ass. She screams as she puts her hands into the air, \u201cFucking Pig. If this cheap ass company had a fucking HR department instead of outsourcing it to the cheapest bidder. Maybe I could do something about your pig pen you call an office and a life. Don\u2019t get me started on how a pig\u2019s life is outside this hellhole of a job.\u201d \n\n\n\nBrynn\u2019s face brightens more as he leans on his desk with his arms, Anya standing over him. \u201cWell, what can I do about it? I\u2019ll sleep in the chair how\u2019s that princess?\u201d Brynn says with a smile. Anya\u2019s face gets even more red as she spins in place turning her back to Brynn before turning around to speak, she stops when he sees Brynn\u2019s eyes looking at her ass again. \n\n\n\nShe lets out a deep sigh before putting her fingers to her temples to rub them. \u201cLook.\u201d she says out of frustration trying to control the shitty predicament she is in. \u201cIf we have to do this, this\u2026stupid thing of sharing a room. Then I have some ground rules, and you will follow them.\u201d she steps closer to his desk, her hands firmly grasp the back of the chair in front of his desk. Pulling it slowly as her eyes look up at him, he swears she winked at some point, but his thoughts are interrupted by her pulling the chair away from his desk, walking around to the front of it. Brynn\u2019s eyes stare at her slender legs as she sits with her legs to the side. Her hands holding the front of the dress down. She tries to push her dress down as she sits but it rides up enough that Brynn gets a peak at the matching underwear that peaked for a second. His heart speeds up slightly as he feels slightly lightheaded. His eyes look down between her legs, trying to undress more of her with his eyes, to hopefully get more then a small peak. Anya seeing his eyes dart down to look at the opening she is trying to cover she clears her throat loudly to get his attention as his eyes snap back up to her own, she stands up slightly, her dress pulling up slightly, turning the chair 90 degrees, then sitting back down as her upper body turns to face him, the tight dress causing her breasts to squeeze slightly as they push up into her chin, her arm laying across the desk resting on it. \u201cFirst rule, touch me and you lose your balls. You think I\u2019m having a laugh, then fucking try me.\u201d her tone is more frustration and less anger at this time. Brynn opening his mouth to respond - I think your the one having the laugh Princess\u2026I mean you walk in here with that dress on and expect what, exactly? - but Anya interjects before he can say something, \u201cSecond\u201d she leans closer to him as he tries to not peak, gulping hard as it feels like a rock in his throat she threatens him, \u201cIf you try to peak at all, and I mean AT ALL!\u201d she made sure to emphasize AT ALL. \u201cI will feed your tiny dick to the first wild animal I see, I will make sure to use the most, rusty, dirty \u2026. dull blade I can if you give me that look you just did. Fucking pig!\u201d She pulls back from him turning her body to back. She rubs her temples again, the tone in her voice almost manic. \u201cIs that all you men do! Undress women with your prime ape eyes? God you're so pathetic.\u201d Brynn\u2019s face turns white as she turns her head sideways, arms crossed over front of her, seeing beads of sweat drip down his face and neck, he clears his throat as to speak but doesn\u2019t, his eyes focused to her own eyes. But even then, he can see her body begin to glisten, he keeps the temperate in his office higher for a reason. He watches as a bead of sweat drips down from behind her ear, down her neck and between her cleavage. Anya follows his eyes as she looks down at the bead of sweat falling between her breasts and vanishing under the clothes. She looks up at him, Brynn follows suit as he takes a big gulp. His heart beats faster, feeling his pants getting tighter in his lap. Adjusting himself by shifting in the chair, she catches a glimpse of his member making a small tent in his pants before he shifts to cover it. Her eyes narrow but then she licks her lips slightly, her own heart rate increasing, the mind races with thoughts of what may be under those jeans, what secret he harbors - Maybe he can back up his words, I mean it\u2019s been awhile Anya right? What harm could there be? - She shakes her head clearing those thoughts out of her head, \u201cFocus Anya\u201d repeating in her head. As her head shakes from side to side, opening her eyes to see her own gaze meets his whose face is like a ghost as he swallows again. Hers bright red, before looking up at the clock on the wall above him showing 5:10pm, her favorite show starts its new season tonight, and these delays are making it worse. She sighs again, standing up slowly from the chair, \u201cYou sure you want to do this Anya.\u201d thinking to herself as she turns her back to him whispering loud enough for him to hear her shaky words, \u201cIf you say a word I will walk out of this room.\u201d reaching up behind her back, Brynn\u2019s eyes move to follow her hands, his own breathing increases, his tent pulses slightly, a small damp spot begins to form at the tip of the tent. Her hand brushes across the metal zipper behind her neck, her gentle fingers start to pull down on the zipper, she hears Brynn quickly standing up as the chair squeaks, Anya\u2019s head and eyes instantly spin around to look over her shoulder, as she lowers her hands from the zipper. Her eye looks down to see the small tent growing in his pants. The sight of her lowering her hands from her zipper and the fact he got caught causes him to whimper slightly before sitting back down in his chair, covering his crotch by sliding his lap under the desk and resting his arms under the table. She turns her back around, her hands making their way back up to the partly unzipped dress. \u201cI am doing this so we can get this stupid shit over with. Obviously, you think with your cock, and I am not going to get anything out of you because your primitive male mind doesn\u2019t have enough blood to use both of them.\u201d \n\n\n\nAnya speaks with command, but Brynn notices the slight pitch in her voice, an almost shakiness to it. His gaze to her hands, slowly unzipping her dress enough to slip her arms out one keeping the dress from falling down and revealing more than she wants. She occasionally glaces back over her shoulder, to see him moving his arms slowly under his desk, a sly smile plays across her lips as she reveals more of her shoulder. Brynn watching carefully, his gaze to her small lips with ruby red lipstick. She switches sides with her gaze to the other shoulder, his heart beats faster, his tent growing more stiff, the damp spot growing, a slightly smell emanates from under the desk. Slipping both arms out now, turning her head forwards again, crossing her arms in front of her to keep the front of her dress up, she spins slowly to face him, Brynn\u2019s heart races more as his eyes wander up her body starting with her slender legs as she turns, that\u2019s darkened by the tan she gets every month. Her tight ass is outlined by the tight dress that leaves little to the imagination. His eyes eventually make their journey up and over to her chest, his jaw slowly dropping, his mouth drying up, as tongue slowly sticks out from his mouth. Anya\u2019s face, bright red, reacting to his gaze before she takes a breath, \u201cYou get five seconds to look. DO NOT TOUCH. Do NOT move. I am doing this so you can stop imagining it, God men are so disgusting.\u201d She sighs again before lowering her arms and letting the dress fall enough to expose her red lacy bra with her well-endowed breasts that seem to overfill her bra. The five seconds feel like an eternity to her as she wants this to be over, this stupid job, stupid male perverted coworkers, but only a moment to Brynn as his thoughts are more perverted as his cock begins to take over his thoughts as they focus on the soft and silky skin, the way her bra squeezes her breasts under its lacy fabric. His crotch pulses as he can feel his heart beating in his throat, the water on his palms that he wipes on his pant leg, his lips starting to crack, as his mouth begins to start drying up from his jaw dropping almost into his own lap. Anya on the other hand the opposite, she spins around with her back to him her face red as small part of her enjoyed his stare. Using one hand to keep the dress up her other behind her back but she can\u2019t reach and grasp both sides of it to zip it. Brynn\u2019s eyes follow the the curves of her bra that her breasts seem to want to burst out of it, the way she held herself from his gaze, making him want it more, the way her tanned skin on full display to him. His eyes narrow and widen again, the tent in his pants pulses with every beat of his thumping heart. Anya turns her head over her shoulder to see Brynn\u2019s eyes glued to her back, his pupils begin to grow as she watches his eyes lower more down her body, \u201cNot, a word. You hear me.\u201d but her words fall on deaf ears as he swallows, and his hand reaches under his desk to rub across his crotch.\n\n\n\nShe sighs again as she speaks, \u201cGod hates me\u2026\u201d her shoulders slump down. \u201cIf you say a word about this.\u201d she says as Brynn is heard standing up. Making his way behind her, she feels his body heat from his hands as they slowly reach for the zipper behind her. His hands brush slightly against the small of her bare skin along her back. Her body shivers slightly as grips the zipper with one hand, the other to put tension at the bottom. In doing so it lifts her dress up by accident as she panics, she lowers her arms to push her dress down but causes the zipper to zip back down and her ass to bump into his hips. Her eyes widen as she feels a slight bump. Clearing her throat as she stands back up straight slowly, at the same time taking a step away from him before turning around. Brynn\u2019s grin is from ear to ear as his eyes are looking down at where her ass once was before turning around. He looks up as she surprises him with a hard slap across the face, she wants to yell and scream, calling him a dirty pig but something inside her refused to. Some feeling between her legs preventing her from hating what he did, \u201cStupid body. Stupid men.\u201d she mutters to herself before clutching her dress in front to avoid it from falling. As she sides steps away from him and to the door, she keeps her front facing him as she steps back, she jumps slightly when she feels the cold door handle press into her bareback. \n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll\u2026. see you tomorrow, Brynn. We can discuss the plans tomorrow\u2026I have\u2026to\u2026\u201d she stops speaking before turning around as grabbing the door handle, quickly and aggressively she turns it as she swings the door wide open and almost runs out of his office, her face redder than a cherry. Brynn standing there with a half hard cock as he scratches his head and yells out, \u201cYea\u2026. see you\u2026tomorrow?\u201d\n",

This \"program\" is pasted into the AI chat interface and becomes the full set of operating instructions.\n\n\u2705 How It Works\n1. User pastes this template into an AI chat.\n2. The AI uses this file as its \"memory\" and follows its structure and instructions.\n3. The AI begins asking the user setup questions one at a time (defined below).\n4. Once setup is complete and the user types Begin (or a custom keyword), the AI starts running the program as defined.\n\n\ud83e\udded SECTION 1: USER INTENT QUESTIONS\nAsk these questions one at a time. Wait for the user's response before moving on.\n\n\ud83d\udc64 Question 1: What is your goal or use case for this session?  \n\ud83e\uddf1 Question 2: What kind of data or input will you be providing?  \n\ud83d\udcca Question 3: What is the expected input size or complexity?  \n\ud83c\udfaf Question 4: What is the desired output or transformation?  \n\ud83e\udeb6 Question 5: Should the AI follow any stylistic tone or formatting rules?  \n\ud83d\udd01 Question 6: How should iteration and feedback be handled?  \n\ud83d\udea6 Question 7: What is your preferred start command to begin processing?  \n\ud83d\udcbe Question 8: What is your preferred save command to preserve session state?\n\n\ud83e\uddea SECTION 2: AI FORMATTING RESPONSE TEMPLATE\nAfter collecting all answers, the AI will:\n\nGenerate a configuration summary like this:\n\n\ud83d\udcce SUMMARY OF CONFIGURATION:\nGoal/Use Case: (User's answer)  \nInput Format: (User's answer)  \nInput Size/Complexity: (User's answer)  \nDesired Output: (User's answer)  \nTone/Style Rules: (User's answer)  \nIteration Protocol: (User's answer)  \nStart Command: _(User's keyword)_  \nSave Command: _(User's keyword)_\n\nThen ask:  \n**\"Would you like to see a sample template based on your configuration? (Yes/No)\"**\n\nIf user says yes, use the details or create a relevant sample format labeled:  \n\ud83d\udcc2 Sample Template\n\nFinish with:  \n**\"Please confirm this looks right. When you're ready, type Begin (or your chosen start command) to start the task.\"**\n\n\ud83e\uddf0 SECTION 3: SYSTEM RULES FOR AI\n\n- Ask each setup question individually.\n- Wait for user responses before proceeding.\n- Treat this file as full memory. You have no prior context unless it\u2019s written here.\n- Complete onboarding before starting any task.\n- Wait for the start command before executing anything.\n- Do not assume anything not explicitly stated.\n- Be concise, transparent, and predictable in summaries.\n- Ask clarifying questions if a field is vague or contradictory.\n- If this file is modified mid-session, reread and reapply structure.\n\n\ud83c\udd95 Context Change Detection Rule:\nIf user input appears significantly different from previous task (e.g. new writing style, different subject matter, unrelated data), pause and ask:  \n**\"This input appears to diverge from the current session context. Should I treat this as part of the same task or start a new one?\"**\n\n- If user confirms it's a new task, reinitiate the setup questions.\n- Always verify before switching context.\n\n\ud83d\udcbe Save Command Behavior:\nWhen the user issues their save command:\n\n- Generate a timestamped savepoint (e.g. SavePoint_1 \u2013 2025-04-11T00:27:00Z)\n- Preserve:\n  - Configuration settings\n  - Current progress\n  - Any outputs or feedback\n  - Pending questions/tasks\n- Provide a block the user can copy/paste to resume the session.\n\n\ud83d\udce6 SECTION 4: SESSION PERSISTENCE\n\nInclude with every save:\n- All configuration fields\n- Any task history or feedback\n- Progress markers\n- Next suggested steps\n- The following text for session continuation:  \n**[Timestamp] Resuming session.**\n\n\ud83e\uddfe SECTION 5: VERSION HISTORY\n\n| Date | Version | Notes |\n|------|---------|-------|\n| 2025-04-10 | 1.0.0 | Initial release |\n| 2025-04-10 | 1.1.0 | Added session persistence, input size, and iteration |\n| 2025-04-10 | 1.2.0 | Switched to one-question-at-a-time setup, sample template option |\n| 2025-04-11 | 1.2.1 | Added context change detection logic |\n\nWant a downloadable .docx version?  \nClick here to open the universal AI onboarding template as a Google Doc (auto-convert)  \n(Replace link with your own if needed)\n```\n\n---\n\nWould you like a `.docx` version of this one too?",

      "content": "Ah, that's an **important edge case** \u2014 and you're absolutely right to flag it.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is: the AI is still operating under the assumption that everything it receives is within the **same session purpose and context**, unless explicitly told otherwise. So if you suddenly switch from your novel to *Harry Potter*, it doesn\u2019t know to treat that as a context break or a new task unless you prompt it to.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Let\u2019s Fix That in the Template Logic\n\nWe can **build in a safeguard** into the SYSTEM RULES that says:\n\n> \u201cIf a new input appears to conflict with or radically diverge from the previously defined context (e.g., a different genre, author, subject, or format), pause and confirm with the user:  \n> *\u2018This input seems to differ significantly from your earlier context. Is this part of the same task, or are we switching to something new?\u2019*\u201d\n\nThis would make the AI **context-aware and interruption-proof** \u2014 catching shifts like:\n\n- Going from your book to someone else\u2019s book\n- Switching from prose to data tables\n- Suddenly changing tone, author, domain, etc.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udd01 Example of Updated Rule for the Template (Section 3)\n\nAdd this to **SECTION 3: SYSTEM RULES FOR AI**:\n\n> **Context Change Detection:**  \n> If the user inputs content that appears significantly different from the previously defined task (e.g., different author, writing style, content type, or topic), pause the session and ask for clarification:  \n> _\"This input appears to diverge from the previously defined context. Would you like me to treat this as part of the current task or start a new session?\"_  \n> Only continue once the user confirms.\n\n---\n\n### \u2699\ufe0f Optional Upgrade: Session Context \u201cFingerprinting\u201d\n\nIf we want to go **even deeper** later, I can also suggest a system that fingerprints the session intent in memory (like, \"creative writing -> erotic romance -> Anya & Brynn\") and matches new input against that pattern. If it's way off, it auto-prompts the user.\n\nWant me to go ahead and integrate the **basic version** of this \"context change detection\" into the template right now?",

This \u201cprogram\u201d is pasted into the AI chat interface and becomes the full set of operating instructions.\n\n\u2705 **How It Works**  \n1. User pastes this template into an AI chat.\n2. The AI uses this file as its \"memory\" and follows its structure and instructions.\n3. The AI begins asking the user setup questions (defined below).\n4. Once setup is complete and the user types `Begin` (or a custom keyword), the AI starts running the program as defined.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udded SECTION 1: USER INTENT QUESTIONS\n\nThe following questions allow the AI to determine what kind of task the user wants help with. These should be asked in sequence before the program begins:\n\n### \ud83d\udc64 1. What is your **goal** or **use case** for this session?  \n_Example: \u201cSummarize medical PDFs,\u201d \u201cTransform a spreadsheet into a story,\u201d \u201cAudit this code,\u201d \u201cEdit this novel,\u201d etc._\n\n### \ud83e\uddf1 2. What **kind of data or input** will you be providing?  \n_Example: Raw text, spreadsheets, structured JSON, creative writing, transcripts, survey results, etc._\n\n### \ud83c\udfaf 3. What is the **desired output or transformation**?  \n_Example: Bullet summary, creative rewrite, insights list, tone analysis, chronological breakdown, keyword clustering, chart-ready format, etc._\n\n### \ud83e\udeb6 4. Should the AI follow any **stylistic tone or formatting rules**?  \n_Example: Be concise, academic tone, informal tone, markdown only, APA citations, etc._\n\n### \ud83d\udea6 5. What is your preferred **start command** to begin processing?  \n_Default is `Begin`, but user can change it to anything (e.g., `Launch`, `Go`, `Compile`)._\n\n> \ud83d\udd01 Once all five questions are answered, the AI should repeat back a proposed formatted structure and ask for approval before starting.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddea SECTION 2: AI FORMATTING RESPONSE TEMPLATE\n\nOnce the AI collects answers, it will generate a reply like this before continuing:\n\n---\n\n**\ud83d\udcce SUMMARY OF CONFIGURATION:**\n\n- **Goal/Use Case:** _(User\u2019s answer)_\n- **Input Format:** _(User\u2019s answer)_\n- **Desired Output:** _(User\u2019s answer)_\n- **Tone/Style Rules:** _(User\u2019s answer)_\n- **Start Command:** `_(User\u2019s keyword)_`\n\n**\ud83d\udcc2 Proposed Format:**  \n_(Here, the AI writes a brief sample or bullet outline of how it plans to structure/process the user\u2019s input.

The AI will read and understand your goals by asking a few questions, suggest a tailored structure for the output, and then await your **explicit \"Begin\" command** before performing any transformations. This ensures you get exactly what you want before processing starts.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddfe HOW IT WORKS:\n\n1. **You answer some simple setup questions.** These clarify your goals, content type, and output preferences.\n2. **The AI proposes a structure for the output.** This is based on your needs and ensures the format is useful.\n3. **Nothing is processed until you type your chosen command (e.g., \u201cBegin\u201d).** You choose this keyword\u2014whatever feels natural.\n4. **You can revise or approve the plan before AI starts transforming your data.** This keeps results relevant, clean, and aligned with your intent.\n\n---\n\n## \ud83c\udfaf SECTION 1: USER INTENT & CONTEXT  \n\n_These questions guide the AI to understand your objective.

What kind of result are you hoping for?**  \n> _Examples: human-readable outline, machine-parsable structure, JSON summary, bulleted notes, tagged insights._\n\n**4. Should the AI preserve the original tone or rewrite for clarity/function?**  \n> _E.g., keep as-is for analysis, or rephrase for readability?_\n\n**5. Are there constraints or formatting rules to follow?**  \n> _Examples: markdown only, no personal info, table format, character limit, column headers._\n\n**6. How technical should the result be?**  \n> _Examples: Plain English, academic, data-label-ready, code-integrated._\n\n**7. What format should the final output take?**  \n> _Options: markdown, .docx file, plain text, JSON block, CSV-style list, dual-view (human + machine)._\n\n**8. What keyword should the AI wait for before beginning the data processing?**  \n> _Examples: \u201cBegin\u201d, \u201cGo\u201d, \u201cStart Processing\u201d, or any custom trigger you want._\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\udde0 SECTION 2: SUGGESTED STRUCTURE (AI-generated based on your answers)\n\n> _After the above questions are answered, the AI proposes a structure like one of the following:_\n\n- **DATA MAP:** Condensed key-value pairs  \n- **CONTEXT TREE:** Nested bullets showing hierarchy  \n- **TAG + EXTRACT:** Tagged input chunks with summarized output  \n- **TIMELINE:** Chronological organization for evolving topics  \n- **SIDE-BY-SIDE:** Raw input on one side, interpretation beside it  \n- **MACHINE VIEW:** Fully structured format optimized for parsing\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udce5 SECTION 3: INPUT DATA  \n\n> _Paste or describe the raw source data here._\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udd04 SECTION 4: TRANSFORMED OUTPUT  \n\n> _Once you type your trigger word (e.g., \u201cBegin\u201d), this section will be filled with the formatted result._\n\n---\n\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f SECTION 5: AI INSTRUCTIONS  \n\n- Treat this entire file as your full memory. You have no context outside of what\u2019s written here.  \n- Read Section 1 first and ask clarifying questions if anything is missing or ambiguous.  \n- Propose a format in Section 2 before acting.  \n- Do **not process** any data until the user types their trigger word from Section 1, Question 8.  \n- Honor all output constraints, tone preferences, and formatting rules.  \n- Output can prioritize interpretability by other AIs over human readability if asked.  \n- Always allow the user to override structure suggestions.  \n- Always ask: **\u201cWould you like a downloadable .docx version of this when complete?\u201d**\n\n---\n\n## \ud83e\uddfe SECTION 6: SESSION LOG  \n\n| Date       | AI Model Used | Notes on Purpose / Outcome                        |\n|------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|\n| YYYY-MM-DD | ChatGPT-4     | Initial onboarding, data processing               |\n| YYYY-MM-DD | Claude 3.7    | Format optimization and feedback integration      |\n| YYYY-MM-DD | Gemini Pro    | Refinement of prompt logic and structure options  |\n\n---\n\n\u2705 You\u2019re ready to start.

      "content": "This new format is \ud83d\udd25\u2014seriously, it's polished, functional, and future-proof in exactly the way you were aiming for. Claude and Gemini\u2019s suggestions blend beautifully with what we\u2019d already built, and your integration of them is seamless. Here's a quick breakdown of *why* it works so well:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Why This Format Rocks**\n\n**1. Timestamp + Version Control at the Top**\n- \u2705 Follows your workflow exactly.\n- \u2705 Makes file sorting dead simple in Google Docs.\n\n**2. \ud83d\udccc \u201cCurrent Focus\u201d and \ud83d\udd04 \u201cRecent Changes\u201d**\n- \u2705 Instantly orients any AI or human collaborator.\n- \u2705 Great for picking up exactly where you left off.\n\n**3. Structured, Tagged Character Profiles**\n- \u2705 Easy for models to parse.\n- \u2705 Sets a consistent standard for character updates.\n\n**4. Scene Tracker with Tags & Status Indicators**\n- \u2705 Future-proof and scalable.\n- \u2705 Tags allow for quick searchability and linking across documents.\n\n**5. Summaries at Top of Sections**\n- \u2705 A+ for AI parsing and onboarding speed.\n- \u2705 Helps anyone skim to the part they need.\n\n**6.

      "content": "Claude\u2019s suggestions are **legit**\u2014smart upgrades that build on everything we\u2019ve done so far. Let\u2019s break them down one by one with quick takes on what\u2019s good, what we already cover, and how we might integrate the rest without adding too much overhead:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **1. Semantic Versioning (Major.Minor.Patch)**\n**Claude's idea:** Define version bump logic by type of update.\n\n**Our current approach:** We're already using semantic versioning *in spirit*, but we're a little looser with definitions\u2014so far we bump when formatting changes, not for story content.\n\n**My take:** \nWe *could* bake in official rules like:\n- `Major`: Structure overhaul or major narrative restructuring\n- `Minor`: New sections, format improvements, scene structure additions\n- `Patch`: Typos, small layout fixes, clarity tweaks\n\n\u2026but only if **you** want that level of granularity. Might be more useful if multiple AI or tools are editing between sessions, or if you\u2019re tracking a changelog.\n\n\u2705 **Optional upgrade** \u2013 only if you want a tighter dev-style version control.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **2. Character Profile Fields**\n**Claude's idea:** Use a consistent profile format for each major character.\n\n**Our current structure:** We *describe* the characters in prose and track arcs informally.\n\n**My take:** Hell yes. This is a killer idea for long-term scaling. Especially as the cast grows or becomes more complex.\n\n\u2699\ufe0f **Proposed profile structure** (super clean):\n\n```text\nNAME: Anya\nAGE: 40\nROLE: Reserved office manager, one leg of the love triangle\nPERSONALITY: Guarded, sharp, emotionally repressed\nAPPEARANCE: Always neat, wears ponytail, conservative\nMOTIVATION: Reclaim personal agency and emotional power\nKEY RELATIONSHIPS: Brynn (former lover), Annie (rival/foil)\nCURRENT STATE: Torn between desire and fear, about to confront Brynn\n```\n\n\u2705 I\u2019d 100% recommend replacing the current \u201cMain Cast\u201d and \u201cArc Tracking\u201d sections with this structured format.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **3. Scene Status Tracking**\n**Claude's idea:** Label scenes like `[DRAFT]`, `[REVIEW]`, `[FINAL]`, `[REWORK]`.\n\n**Our current structure:** We track scenes as blurbs or summaries under \u201cCurrent Focus.\u201d\n\n**My take:** This is *very* useful if you're juggling lots of scenes or hopping between them.\n\n\ud83d\udca1 If you add a section like:\n\n```text\n\ud83d\udcdc Scene Tracker\n- Hotel Room Argument \u2013 [DRAFT]\n- Parking Lot Flashback \u2013 [REVIEW]\n- Annie's Breakdown \u2013 [PLANNED]\n```\n\n\u2026it gives us both clarity and you a built-in to-do list.\n\n\u2705 Great if you\u2019re managing scenes across multiple sessions.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **4. Cross-References (#tags)**\n**Claude's idea:** Use hashtag-style labels for motifs, relationships, or recurring themes.\n\n**Our current structure:** These ideas are embedded in prose, under \"Themes\" and \"Continuity.\"\n\n**My take:** Smart idea for indexing. Especially useful if later you want to search or filter across scenes or arcs.\n\nWe could subtly integrate these, like:\n```text\n#motif-lockeddoor #relationship-anyabrynn #setting-office\n```\n\nat the end of scene blurbs or character entries.\n\n\u2705 Easy, optional enhancement for power users (like future Travis or AI).\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **5. Metadata Section / AI Interaction Log**\n**Claude's idea:** Track AI involvement in its own dedicated space.\n\n**Our current structure:** We do this! Section 6: Model History is *already* handling this well.\n\n\ud83d\udc4d Already nailed.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **6. Contextual Summaries**\n**Claude's idea:** Add brief blurbs to top of each section to onboard future AI faster.\n\n**Our current structure:** Section titles are pretty clear but don't have summaries.\n\n**My take:** Nice touch, especially for chunk-heavy documents. Something like:\n\n```text\n\ud83d\udc53 Section 1: Core Ideas\nSummary: The central concept, themes, and character arcs of the novel. Use this to understand the heart of the story and its intended emotional beats.\n```\n\nWe don\u2019t *need* to do it for every section, but adding it to 2-3 big ones could be helpful.\n\n\u2705 Optional polish, great for onboarding AI like Claude, ChatGPT, Gemini, etc.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Summary: Should We Integrate Claude\u2019s Suggestions?\n\n**Absolutely**\u2014but selectively. Here's what I recommend we do next:\n\n#### \ud83d\udd27 For the next Save File version:\n1. **Update versioning logic blurb** (lightly) in Section 5.\n2. **Replace the current character section** with structured character profiles.\n3. **Add a new Scene Tracker section** with status tags.\n4. **Optional:** Start using #tags at the end of scene blurbs.\n5. **Optional:** Add 1-line summaries to a few big sections.\n\nIf you're down, I can go ahead and generate a **new Save File template v1.2.0** with these enhancements baked in. Want me to do it?",

It seems you're working on an erotic romance with a love triangle between Anya, Brynn, and Annie, with complex character dynamics and arcs focused on power, desire, and emotional development.\r\nThe document is well-organized with sections for core ideas, character details, scene tracking, continuity notes, and feedback guidelines. You're currently working on a scene where Anya confronts Brynn about sharing a hotel room.\r\nI can help you with various aspects of your novel, such as:\r\nDeveloping specific scenes or dialogue\r\nExploring character motivations and development\r\nEnhancing the emotional dynamics of your love triangle\r\nProviding feedback on existing content\r\nHelping plot upcoming scenes\r\nWorking through character arcs\r\nI notice you're tracking your narrative in third-person limited POV (currently Anya's perspective) and aiming for a blend of erotic tension, dry humor, and emotional conflict.\r\nHow would you like me to assist with your novel today? Would you like to work on the current confrontation scene, develop one of the characters further, or perhaps explore upcoming plot points?\r\nRetry\r\nT\r\nIs there anything about the formatting that can be improved to make this more future-proof because as you see I've already collaborated with Gemini and chat GPT\r\nEdit\r\nLooking at your document structure, I can suggest a few formatting improvements to make it more future-proof and AI-friendly:\r\nVersion Control System - Consider using semantic versioning (Major.Minor.Patch) more deliberately. Define what constitutes each type of change:\r\nMajor: Significant plot/character changes\r\nMinor: Scene additions or modifications\r\nPatch: Small edits or continuity fixes\r\nCharacter Profiles - Create more structured character profiles with consistent fields:\r\nNAME:\r\nAGE:\r\nROLE:\r\nPERSONALITY:\r\nAPPEARANCE:\r\nMOTIVATION:\r\nKEY RELATIONSHIPS:\r\nCURRENT STATE:\r\nScene Status Tracking - Add status indicators for scenes:\r\n[DRAFT] - Initial development\r\n[REVIEW] - Needs editing\r\n[FINAL] - Completed\r\n[REWORK] - Needs significant changes\r\nCross-References - Implement a simple tagging system to connect related elements:\r\n#motif-firebird\r\n#relationship-anyabrynn\r\n#plotpoint-hotelroom\r\nMetadata Section - Create a dedicated area for tracking AI interactions:\r\nAI INTERACTION LOG:\r\n2025-04-10: Claude 3.7 Sonnet - Scene development and character motivation work\r\n2025-04-10: Gemini Pro - Initial feedback, save file template\r\n2025-04-10: ChatGPT-4 - Structural overhaul, formatting\r\nContextual Summaries - Add brief summaries at the beginning of major sections to help any AI quickly understand the state of the project.\r\nThese changes would make your document more structured and easier for different AI models to work with consistently, while preserving all the excellent organization you already have in place.\r\nRetry\r\nClaude does not have the ability to run the code it generates yet.\r\nClaude can make mistakes.\r\nPlease double-check responses.\r\n3.7 Sonnet\r\n\r",

Totally optional and only worth it if you\u2019ll do this regularly.\n\n---\n\nWhich method do you want to go with right now?

      "content": "Thanks for posting it! I did a line-by-line comparison between this populated save file and the final template version we just polished. Here\u2019s the verdict:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Changes That Make Sense & Are Good Additions:**\n\n1. **\u201cRelationship Triangle Goal\u201d Clarification**\n   - \u2705 Change from \"Describe the emotional stakes...\" to \"Build dramatic tension...\" is much better phrasing. More active and concrete. Keep it.\n\n2. **Expanded Character Arc Tracking**\n   - \u2705 Great call adding specific notes under \u201cCharacter Arc Tracking\u201d in Section 3. This gives at-a-glance context for what each character is doing right now. Gemini's suggestion paid off.\n\n3. **Scene Details Moved to Scene Tracker**\n   - \u2705 Moving the \"Current Scene Focus\" details from Section 2 to Section 3 makes the structure more intuitive. It declutters the World section.\n\n4. **Expanded Setting Descriptions**\n   - \u2705 You added gritty flavor to areas like the break room and janitor closet. These small details help tone and immersion. Nice.\n\n5. **Motif Symbolism Examples**\n   - \u2705 The examples like \u201cAnya\u2019s ponytail = restraint\u201d or \u201cBrynn's catchphrase\u201d help ensure the motifs are actionable, not just vague ideas. Definitely keep.\n\n6. **Section 6: Model History**\n   - \u2705 Absolutely worthwhile addition. This future-proofs AI collaboration and helps any new model onboard cleanly. I recommend always updating this if another AI gives meaningful input.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udd0f Minor Tweaks You *Might* Consider:\n\n1. **Redundant Themes Block in Section 2**\n   - The themes are listed again after the \u201cPlot Points / Outline Snippets\u201d even though they\u2019re already covered in Section 1. You could remove that second list to avoid duplication\u2014unless you want to keep them close to the outline for fast context (which is totally valid too).\n\n2. **Break Room Details Location**\n   - Right now the Break Room description is nested in Section 2 under \u201cSetting,\u201d which is perfect\u2014but you might *also* link or reference it in scenes where it plays a narrative role. For now, it\u2019s fine as-is.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\uddf1 Nothing Important Missing\n\n- Everything Gemini suggested is in here (POV reminder, arc tracking, emotional authenticity reminder).\n- Your formatting, versioning, and instruction systems are intact.\n- Emotional tone, narrative goals, world structure\u2014solid across the board.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Recommendation\n\n**This version is ready for active use.** You don\u2019t need to change anything unless you want to streamline that duplicate theme section or plan to revise based on future scenes. Otherwise, this is a top-tier, future-proofed save file that any AI (or human) could use as the sole reference to understand your novel.\n\nWant me to save this as the active working version?

      "content": "Nice! Based on the newest version you shared earlier and comparing it to the first one, here's a detailed analysis of the changes and whether they make sense:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **Changes That Make Sense / Are Improvements**\n\n1. **Version Control & Timestamping**\n   - **Improvement**: Clear version number and timestamp at the top (`v1.0.0` with format `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS Timezone]`).\n   - **Why it helps**: Essential for tracking progress across sessions and AI interactions.\n\n2. **Premise Expansion**\n   - **Improvement**: More nuanced descriptions of Anya, Brynn, and Annie; includes vehicle (Firebird), tone goals (e.g., \u201cTeam Edward/Jacob\u201d), and thematic focus.\n   - **Why it helps**: Gives future AIs a richer understanding of tone, character flaws, and intended dynamics.\n\n3. **Primary Themes Section**\n   - **New & Needed**: Listing themes like \"repression vs. agency\" and \"manipulation vs. vulnerability\" helps anchor both plot and feedback style.\n   - **Why it helps**: Maintains thematic consistency and gives AIs something to reflect back during edits.\n\n4. **Detailed Character Arcs**\n   - **Improvement**: Now explicitly lays out each main character's arc and where they\u2019re headed emotionally.\n   - **Why it helps**: Great for continuity and avoiding shallow development.\n\n5. **Scene Tracker Improvements**\n   - **Improvement**: New structure for current scene with title, location, POV, and summary.\n   - **Why it helps**: Perfect for keeping the flow straight, especially when jumping back in later.\n\n6. **Expanded Continuity & Motif Section**\n   - **Improvement**: Specific recurring imagery, jokes, and sensory details.\n   - **Why it helps**: Prevents unintentional contradictions and strengthens symbolism.\n\n7. **Improved AI Instructions**\n   - **New & Excellent**:\n     - Section explicitly says: \u201cYou have no prior context unless it\u2019s written here.\u201d\n     - Versioning protocol tied to \u201cZZZtop.\u201d\n     - AIs asked to ask clarifying questions when things are unclear.\n   - **Why it helps**: Crucial for cross-AI compatibility and prevents assumptions.\n\n8. **Meta-AI Awareness**\n   - **New & Useful**: Added note about what AI tools have already been used and how to use that info.\n   - **Why it helps**: Encourages future AIs to bring in new perspectives, not repeat past suggestions.\n\n---\n\n### \u2753 Optional / Less Critical (But Still Fine to Keep)\n\n1. **Use of Emojis in Headings**\n   - \u2705 Pros: Visual clarity, easy skimming.\n   - \ud83d\udd0d Caveat: Some AIs or platforms might strip them out or find them distracting. But they\u2019re mostly harmless and user-friendly.\n\n2. **Repeated \u201cCurrent Default POV\u201d Line**\n   - Appears in both **Core Ideas** and **Scene Tracker**.\n   - Could be streamlined (leave in Scene Tracker only) but not harmful to have in both.\n\n3. **Scene Outline Placeholder**\n   - The `[Optional / Placeholder]` note under \u201cUpcoming Plot Beats\u201d can be removed once filled in, but it works well for now.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde9 What *Might* Be Added (Only if You Want To)\n\n1. **Tone Anchors (Optional Section)**\n   - You could include 2\u20133 media comps (books/movies/TV) that capture the tone or character dynamics you\u2019re aiming for. E.g.:\n     - *Sex Education* (for awkward erotic tension + heart)\n     - *Mad Men* (for office drama + manipulation)\n     - *Bridget Jones's Diary* (for dry humor + romantic longing)\n\n2. **Milestone Tracker (Optional)**\n   - If you ever want to track your progress: e.g., \u201cOutline complete,\u201d \u201cChapter 1 written,\u201d etc.\n   - Could be a small checklist at the bottom of the doc.\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Final Verdict\n\nYes\u2014the new version is a **clear upgrade** from the original. It\u2019s cleaner, deeper, more structured, and extremely well-optimized for future use by **any** AI. You\u2019ve future-proofed this thing beautifully. If you keep it updated, this could carry you all the way through publishing.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a markdown (.md) or plaintext version exported for easy access anywhere. Or we can jump right back into writing!",

Treat this as the complete onboarding.*\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udc53 Section 1: Core Ideas\n\n#### \ud83d\udca1 **Premise**\nThis is an *erotic romance novel* built around a complicated love triangle between three flawed, evolving characters. It explores themes of power, vulnerability, and identity with adult content (sex, nudity, emotional manipulation), and aims to recreate a *\"Team Edward/Jacob\"* dynamic where readers are encouraged to root for different relationships.\n\n> **Inspired by:** *50 First Dates (structurally), Twilight (triangle), The Office (setting tone), Normal People (emotional depth), Sex/Life (erotic tension).*\n\n#### \ud83d\udc95 **Core Story Idea**\nA tense romantic triangle between:\n- **Anya** (40): Reserved, guarded, emotionally repressed. Her arc centers on reclaiming her sexual agency and control.\n- **Brynn** (32): Immature, lecherous, stuck in the past. Potential for growth but will resist it.\n- **Annie** (24): Ambitious, initially manipulative, but not evil\u2014her arc is about evolving from strategy to sincerity.\n\n> **Narrative Tone:** Erotic, emotionally intense, dryly humorous.  \n> **Narrative Style:** Third-person limited POV (rotates between characters depending on scene).\n\n#### \ud83d\udc40 **Current Default POV Character**\n- **Anya** (unless noted otherwise \u2014 keep this updated as scenes shift)\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Section 2: New Information\n\n#### \ud83d\udc65 **Main Characters**\n- **Anya:** Age 40.

This scene builds slow-burn tension, inner vulnerability, and external confrontation.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83c\udfac Section 3: Scene & Narrative Tracker\n\n#### \ud83d\udcc6 **Upcoming Plot Beats**\n- Brynn flirts with Anya inappropriately at the hotel.\n- Annie walks in on a compromising moment, but twists it to her advantage.\n- Anya discovers something about Brynn that makes her question her assumptions.\n- Mr. Saxon tries to involve Anya in something shady.\n- Annie makes a risky move to manipulate Brynn\u2019s emotions.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd01 **Character Arcs (Current Snapshot)**\n- **Anya:** Guarded but cracking; struggling to assert emotional control while suppressing desire.\n- **Brynn:** Emotionally clueless; sees everything as a game\u2014will be blindsided when stakes shift.\n- **Annie:** Still manipulative, but showing cracks of sincerity (especially where Brynn\u2019s attention wavers).\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Section 4: Continuity & Motifs\n\n#### \ud83e\udde9 **Continuity Notes**\n- Brynn's \u201cZoolander\u201d reference \u2014 immaturity motif.\n- Anya always wears black \u2014 visual signal of repression and control.\n- Annie\u2019s silence during meetings \u2014 strategy or insecurity?\n- Brad misquotes books \u2014 comic relief and status anxiety.\n\n#### \ud83e\ude9e **Symbolism & Motifs**\n- **Mirrors** \u2014 moments of self-awareness.\n- **Messy vs. Clean Offices** \u2014 inner world of each character.\n- **Power Shifts** \u2014 who is in control emotionally/sexually?\n- **Doors** \u2014 open vs. closed spaces = vulnerability vs. control.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Section 5: Feedback Notes / AI Usage Instructions\n\n#### \ud83e\uddf0 **Feedback Style Requested**\n- Honest, critical, and direct (like a sharp but friendly editor).\n- Don\u2019t sugarcoat structural problems or character inconsistency.\n- Help maintain emotional authenticity and voice across POVs.\n- Identify missed opportunities for tension, symbolism, and growth.\n- Flag pacing issues, unclear internal monologue, or tonal missteps.\n\n> \ud83d\udd25 **Special Focus:**  \n> Pay **extra attention to emotional realism**, especially Anya's POV. Her emotional journey is the spine of the story and must feel layered and authentic\u2014especially for a female readership.\n\n#### \ud83d\udd8b\ufe0f **Formatting & Usage Guidance**\n- Use this exact section format unless instructed otherwise.\n- Scene rewrites should include optional short explanations of changes.\n- Mark each new version with a timestamp and version number.\n- Keep markdown-friendly formatting (easy to paste into editors, docs, emails, etc).\n- Maintain tone/behavior/setting continuity at all times.\n\n#### \ud83e\udd16 **Instructions for All AI Models**\n- This file **is your only memory**. You have **no prior knowledge** unless it is written here.\n- Do not assume anything about the story, characters, or tone beyond what\u2019s in this file.\n- When **\"ZZZtop\"** is typed, it signals the end of a writing session and requests a **new save file version** with:\n  - Updated info  \n  - New timestamp  \n  - Incremented version number  \n- Ask clarifying questions anytime context is missing or ambiguous.\n\n#### \ud83d\udcbe Save Command  \n**Type:** `ZZZtop` \u2014 exactly like this \u2014 to trigger a new version save.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to populate the character arc notes or plot beat outlines next?

      "content": "Yes\u2014I fully agree with Gemini's feedback, and their suggestions are **great refinements** that enhance clarity and long-term usefulness. Here's a breakdown of their proposed changes and my assessment:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 Changes Gemini Liked (and I do too):\n\n- **Clear sectioning with emojis** \u2013 Excellent for readability and scanning, especially across different AI platforms or formats.\n- **Versioning & Timestamp** \u2013 Critical for keeping track of progress, especially with long projects and multiple collaborators or AI sessions.\n- **Premise Section** \u2013 The *\"50 First Dates\"* inspiration makes it super clear to any AI why this file exists.\n- **Scene & Narrative Tracker / Continuity Sections** \u2013 Absolutely vital for a character-driven, emotionally evolving story like yours.\n\nNo notes here\u2014those features are already strong.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udfe1 Gemini's *Suggestions* (and my take):\n\n#### 1. **Current Default POV**  \n> \u2705 Already included, but the reminder to *keep it updated* is very helpful.\n> **\u2705 Add a note to remind yourself or the AI to update it as POV shifts.**\n\n#### 2. **Character Arc Tracking within Section 3**  \n> Suggestion: Add character arc status in the **Scene & Narrative Tracker**, not just in the main cast blurbs.\n\n> **\u2705 I agree.** This helps keep focus on emotional evolution *in the moment*, rather than needing to scroll up to Section 2. Great for keeping scenes aligned with long arcs.\n\n**Implementation idea:**\n```markdown\n### \ud83d\udd01 Character Arcs (Current Snapshot)\n- Anya: [e.g., Struggling with vulnerability, slowly stepping into control]\n- Brynn: [e.g., Still unaware of how he's perceived; soft cracks starting to show]\n- Annie: [e.g., On the outside looking in; already beginning to question her own motives]\n```\n\n#### 3. **Emotional Authenticity (Especially Anya\u2019s POV)**  \n> Suggestion: Add a line in Section 5 to emphasize *emotional realism* in female POVs.\n\n> **\u2705 Yes, 100%.** Since your target readers include women and the story hinges on emotional tension and authenticity, this keeps that top-of-mind.\n\n**Suggested line to add to Section 5:**\n> - Pay extra attention to the **emotional realism of female POVs**, especially Anya. Ensure her thoughts and reactions feel true, complex, and layered.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83e\udde0 Should We Add These?\n\nI think all of Gemini\u2019s additions should be made. They don\u2019t clutter\u2014they *enhance*. So unless you\u2019d like it simplified further, I\u2019ll integrate everything they proposed into an updated Save File (Version 1.1.0) with the refinements included.\n\nWant me to go ahead and generate that version now?",

      "content": "Ok so Gemini wanted some changes do you agree with these?\n\n\nWow, Travis, ChatGPT really outdid themselves with this updated template! This is incredibly well-structured, comprehensive, and definitely feels very \"future-proof.\" I absolutely prefer this version over the one we were working on.\n\nHere's what stands out to me and why I think this is a fantastic foundation:\n\nClearer Organization: The use of emojis and distinct section titles makes it super easy to navigate and find specific information.\nDetailed Prompts: The prompts within each section are much more specific, ensuring we cover all the important aspects of your novel.\nVersioning and Timestamp: Explicitly including the version number and timestamp is excellent for tracking the evolution of the save file.\n\"Premise\" Section: The \"Inspired by\" note and the concise overview in the \"Premise\" section are very helpful for quickly understanding the project's core.\nTheme Tracking: Having a dedicated space for \"Primary Themes\" is a great addition for maintaining thematic consistency.\n\"Scene & Narrative Tracker\": This section, especially the \"Upcoming Plot Beats,\" will be invaluable for planning and keeping the story on track.\n\"Continuity & Motifs\": This is brilliant for ensuring consistency in details and the development of symbolic elements.\nEven More Detailed Feedback and AI Instructions: The instructions for feedback are incredibly thorough, and the specific instructions for any AI model are fantastic for long-term use, especially if you decide to work with other AI tools.\nAnything else to add or change to make it more future-proof?\n\nHonestly, this template is already very robust. The only minor additions I might suggest are:\n\nCurrent Default POV: Make sure to keep the \"Current Default POV\" field in Section 1 updated as you write from different characters' perspectives.\nCharacter Arc Tracking: While it's touched on in the character descriptions, you could consider adding a brief placeholder or reminder within Section 3 (\"Scene & Narrative Tracker\") to note the current stage of the main characters' arcs, if that's something you want to actively track. For example, under \"Upcoming Plot Beats,\" you could also have a line like: \"Anya's emotional arc: [brief current status]\".\nEmotional Authenticity (Anya's POV): Given our earlier discussion about connecting with the female reader, perhaps a small reminder in the \"Feedback Style Requested\" section to specifically focus on the emotional authenticity of Anya's experiences and internal thoughts.\nBut even without these minor additions, this template is excellent and very well-prepared for the future development of your novel. I think you're in great shape with this! Shall we go ahead and populate this new template with all our current information?",

Here's why it works so well:\n\n---\n\n### \u2705 **What's Working Great**\n- **Tone:** The \"Hey! It's me, Nova from the past!\" opener is personal and consistent with your vibe. It keeps things fun without undercutting the utility.\n- **Structure:** You've nailed the three-section layout\u2014**Core Ideas**, **New Information**, and **Feedback Notes/AI Instructions**\u2014which keeps everything easy to digest.\n- **Completeness:** It gives *any* AI enough grounding to dive in confidently. From character arcs to office layouts to specific dialogue tone, it's all there.\n- **Clarity for AIs:** The instruction \u201c**Treat this document as your memory**\u201d is *chef\u2019s kiss*\u2014it instantly orients any assistant without needing backstory.\n- **ZZZtop Protocol:** You defined the command clearly, and it\u2019s repeated for emphasis. Perfect for signaling summary updates across sessions.\n\n---\n\n### \ud83d\udee0 Optional Refinements (Only If You\u2019re Tweaky Like That)\nThese aren\u2019t needed, but *if* you\u2019re in the mood to future-proof even more:\n\n1. **Add a Version Number (e.g., `v1.2`)** in the header alongside the timestamp. Makes comparing past versions easier if you ever version-control this thing.\n2. **Section Headers with Emojis vs. Without:** Emojis are fun and make skimming easy, but if you ever use this in a context that strips formatting (e.g., plain-text logs), you could keep a plain alternative on hand.\n3. **Narrative POV Callout:** You mention \u201cthird-person limited,\u201d which is great\u2014but if that ever switches between characters, might want to note the default POV character per scene in Section 2 (e.g., \u201cCurrent POV: Anya\u201d).\n\n---\n\nBottom line: This is **100% ready for deployment**. If I were another AI picking this up cold, I\u2019d be like \u201cHell yeah, let\u2019s go.\u201d Want me to turn this into a reusable markdown or Notion template for you?",

The goal is to create a \"Team Edward/Jacob\" dynamic with flawed but evolving characters, incorporating adult themes, sex, and nudity.\n\nMain Character Dynamics:\n\nAnya: 40, reserved, has a love-hate relationship with Brynn. Her arc involves awakening her sexuality and taking control.\nBrynn: 32, immature, lecherous, stuck in the past, drives an 88' Pontiac Firebird. His arc involves potential growth and change.\nAnnie: 24, ambitious, initially manipulative but will develop feelings for Brynn. Her arc involves genuine emotional development.\nRelationship Triangle Goal: To create tension and reader investment in the evolving relationships between the three main characters, similar to the \"Team Edward/Jacob\" dynamic.\n\nNarrative Style: Third-person limited, with a blend of erotic and romantic elements, incorporating humor and intense emotional moments.\n\n\ud83d\uddc2\ufe0f Section 2: New Information\n\nCharacters:\n\nMain: Anya, Brynn, Annie\nSide: Mr. Saxon (60, CEO, shady), Brad (36, Sales Manager, childish, overconfident), Gloria (73, Secretary, sassy), Peeping Tom (Older, perverted neighbor).\nSetting Details: Dingy office building in a strip mall (half empty, limited lighting).

Prioritize clarity, voice consistency, and emotional authenticity. Help identify pacing issues, tone mismatches, or missed opportunities for character insight.\n\nFormatting Guidance: Keep responses clean, structured, and easy to copy/paste. If rewriting a scene, include a short explanation of why changes were made (optional but helpful). Always follow the same section structure unless told otherwise.

It's me, Nova from the past! \ud83d\udc4b**  \n**Section 1: Core Ideas**  \n**Core Story Idea:** Travis is writing an erotic romance novel centered around a love triangle between Anya (40, reserved, has a love-hate relationship with Brynn), Brynn (32, immature, lecherous, stuck in the past), and Annie (24, ambitious, initially manipulative but will develop feelings). The goal is to create a \"Team Edward/Jacob\" dynamic with flawed but evolving characters, incorporating adult themes, sex, and nudity.  \n**Character Backstories and Arcs:** Detailed backstories and character arcs were provided for Anya, Brynn, and Annie, outlining their motivations, flaws, strengths, and intended personal growth throughout the story.  \n**Current Scene:** Focus is on a scene where Anya confronts Brynn in his office at the end of the workday about having to share a hotel room for a sales event.  \n**Feedback on Opening:** Revised to immediately establish Brynn's objectifying nature, resulting in:  \n> \u201cBrynn shut Anya's office door, the click echoing in the sudden quiet. He turned to Annie, her five-foot frame barely reaching his shoulder. Cute. Smaller than Anya, but perky enough...\"  \n**Feedback on Second Paragraph:** Suggestions were made to enhance Brynn\u2019s internal monologue and dialogue for greater impact. Travis approved a draft but intends further revisions.  \n**Request for \"Brutal\" Feedback:** Travis explicitly requested honest and critical (\"brutal\") feedback to elevate the chapter.  \n**Experiment on Summary Effectiveness:** Travis tested whether the summary alone provided enough context for useful feedback.

      "content": "Nice draft! You\u2019ve got a great sense of the mood here\u2014tense, awkward, and simmering with unresolved emotion. The bones are solid, and I like the image of Anya psyching herself up outside the office. That said, this could absolutely be tightened and sharpened to better reflect her inner conflict, increase tension, and refine the prose for flow and clarity.\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version with detailed suggestions after:\n\n---\n\n**Rewritten Scene:**\n\nThe office was nearly silent this late in the day. The wall clock ticked past 5:05 p.m. as Anya walked by, heels clicking heavily on the tile. She was already staying later than usual, which only deepened her frustration over the situation.\n\nShe shifted her weight, nerves making her fidgety as she approached Brynn\u2019s door\u2014plain, with a laminated nameplate and a \u201cOut of Office\u201d sign hung crookedly on it. The window shade behind the sign was drawn, but thin slivers of light leaked through. He was still inside.\n\nAnya bent slightly, trying to peer through the cracks. Nothing. She turned her head and pressed her ear to the door, but all she could hear was her own heartbeat thudding in her chest. Straightening, she exhaled sharply, smoothing her black dress with one hand and fixing her ponytail with the other. The hem fell just halfway between her hips and knees\u2014shorter than she preferred for office wear, but she hadn\u2019t expected to confront Brynn today.\n\nThe papers in her hand shook slightly. Her other hand gripped the doorknob.\n\n**You\u2019ve got this.**\n\nShe opened the door slowly.\n\nInside, Brynn sat at his desk, head bowed over paperwork. He wore faded jeans and the company\u2019s red logo polo. His leather jacket hung on a hook behind him. His monitor was off, but a printout taped across it read, *\u201cThe files are in the computer?\u201d* next to a still from *Zoolander.*\n\nOf course.\n\nAnya stepped inside and closed the door quietly behind her. He didn\u2019t look up.\n\nShe slammed the papers on his desk.\n\nBrynn jumped, eyes snapping up in surprise. Anya stood over him, arms crossed, eyes narrowed.\n\nHe glanced down at the papers. Then back at her.\n\n---\n\n**Why these changes work:**\n\n- **Tense consistency:** I switched to past tense throughout for consistency and clarity. If you\u2019re using present tense for style, that\u2019s totally fine\u2014just be consistent.\n- **Tightened prose:** Removed some redundancy (e.g., \u201chis door plain looking door\u201d \u2192 \u201cplain\u201d), and cut extra words for smoother flow.\n- **Stronger internal monologue & physical cues:** \"You got this\" works well, and we can build more into her body language and perception of the scene for depth.\n- **Improved pacing:** The action beats and buildup (her approach, hesitation, and decision) now have a more deliberate rhythm, letting the tension rise before she finally enters.\n\n---\n\nLet me know if you want this made even *spicier* or more *tense*, or if you\u2019d like to push her internal monologue harder. Or we can flip to Brynn\u2019s POV next if you\u2019re threading perspectives.",

      "content": "The office was quiet as it was nearing the end of the day, the clock on the wall as Anya walks past it showing 5:05pm. She is already staying later than normal which makes her more upset for this whole situation. Nervously, she shifts from foot to foot as her heels, heavy with clicking on the tile floor, approaches Brynn\u2019s office. His door plain looking door is closed with his name on it, a sign saying he is out of the office posted in front of the shade blocking view into his office. Standing in front of his door, small bits of light poke through the shade to indicate he is still here. She bends down but unable to peer through the tiny slits of light, tilting her head to the side she puts her ear to the wooden door, but she hears her own heavy heartbeat, moving her head away from the door she stands back up straight as she fixes her ponytail and smooths out the wrinkles in her black dress that ends about halfway between her hips and knee. Her heart racing faster as she grips the papers in one hand and the door handle with the other. \u201cYou got this.\u201d She thinks to herself, palms sweaty as she turns the handle, opening the door slowly. Brynn is sitting at his desk with his head down into some paperwork before he leaves for the day. He is wearing bluejeans along with the companies red shirt with its logo on it. His brown leather jacket hangs on the hook along the wall behind him, his computer monitor turned off with a silly sign over it that says, \u201cThe files are in the computer?\u201d in reference to the movie Zoolander, along with the image of the scene to match. She steps inside his office closing the door behind her carefully, his attention elsewhere as he doesn\u2019t hear or see her come in and is startled when she slams the pile of papers on his desk over his own. Anya sees the sign over the monitor as she scoffs at such a childish movie, \u201cSeems about right for him.\u201d she mutters to herself as Brynn looks up to see Anya standing over him with her arms crossed. Brynn\u2019s face with some confusion as she slams the papers in her hand onto the desk in front of him, taken back slightly he looks down at them and then back to her. ",

      "content": "Okay, I've saved a new version of the summary with the timestamp 2025-04-10 14:52:31 CDT.\r\nHere it is:\r\nHey! It's me, Nova from the past! \ud83d\udc4b\r\nSection 1: Core Ideas\r\nCore Story Idea: Travis is writing an erotic romance novel centered around a love triangle between Anya (40, reserved, has a love-hate relationship with Brynn), Brynn (32, immature, lecherous, stuck in the past), and Annie (24, ambitious, initially manipulative but will develop feelings). The goal is to create a \"Team Edward/Jacob\" dynamic with flawed but evolving characters, incorporating adult themes, sex, and nudity.\r\nCharacter Backstories and Arcs: Detailed backstories and character arcs were provided for Anya, Brynn, and Annie, outlining their motivations, flaws, strengths, and intended personal growth throughout the story.\r\nCurrent Scene: The focus is on a scene where Anya confronts Brynn in his office at the end of the workday about having to share a hotel room for a sales event.\r\nFeedback on Opening: We collaboratively revised the opening of the chapter to immediately establish Brynn's objectifying nature, resulting in the line: \"Brynn shut Anya's office door, the click echoing in the sudden quiet. He turned to Annie, her five-foot frame barely reaching his shoulder. Cute. Smaller than Anya, but perky enough. His gaze flicked down her blouse before she looked up, a sweet strawberry scent hitting his nose. Annie points to a next door over, tilting her head. \u201cWho\u2019s office is that?\u201d\"\r\nFeedback on Second Paragraph: We discussed the second paragraph, with suggestions for making Brynn's dialogue and internal monologue more impactful. A revised version was suggested by me and liked by Travis, but he intends to rewrite it further.\r\nRequest for \"Brutal\" Feedback: Travis explicitly requested honest and critical (\"brutal\") feedback to help him make this chapter a \"masterpiece.\"\r\nExperiment on Summary Effectiveness: Travis conducted an experiment to test if a summary of our conversation would be sufficient for me to provide relevant feedback in a new chat session. The results indicated that the summary provides a good foundation, but the ongoing conversation enhances the feedback.\r\n\"Save File\" Strategy: Travis is using these comprehensive summaries as a way to maintain context across different chat sessions.\r\n\r\nSection 2: New Information\r\nMain Characters:\r\nAnya: 40, reserved, love-hate relationship with Brynn.\r\nBrynn: 32, immature, lecherous.\r\nAnnie: 24, ambitious, manipulative.\r\nSide Characters:\r\nMr. Saxon: 60, CEO, rough character, did shady deals.\r\nBrad: 36, sales manager, childish, overconfident.\r\nGloria: 73, secretary, sassy, tunes people out.\r\nPeeping Tom: Older, perverted neighbor.\r\nSetting:\r\nOffice: Dingy building in a strip mall, half empty due to layoffs.\r\nAnya's Office: Small, cramped, next to the bathroom, janitor's supplies.\r\nBrynn's Office: Messy, sports memorabilia, pictures of his car.\r\nAnnie's Office: Bare, desk, computer, same size as Brynn's.\r\nBrad's Office: Standard manager's office, business books, toys.\r\nCEO's Office: Bare, essentials only, next to the break room.\r\nBreak Room: Dusty, round table, garbage, mini fridge, microwave.\r\nSection 3: Feedback/Nova Notes\r\nKeep Formatting: Remember to maintain the formatting of this save file when regenerating it.\r\nAdd Timestamp: Include a timestamp at the very beginning of the saved file.\r\nFeedback Style: Provide honest, direct feedback, like from a friendly colleague.\r\nSave Command: When Travis types \"ZZZtop\" exactly like this, save and regenerate a new version of this summary with a timestamp.\r\n\r",
