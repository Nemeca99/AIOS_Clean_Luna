      "content": "Yeah, that definitely sounds like a *Gemini-specific* hiccup, especially if:\n\n- Your internet is working fine (evidenced by you being here).\n- Other websites/services are loading.\n- The error says **\"No internet connection\"** *within* Gemini itself.\n\nThis is a known issue that occasionally pops up when Gemini has a backend disruption or a bug in the app/browser version. A few quick things you can try:\n\n### 🔧 Quick Fixes:\n1. **Refresh the tab** or **restart the app** (if using mobile).\n2. **Clear cache/cookies** for the Gemini site.\n3. **Try a different browser or device** to see if it’s local.\n4. **Disable VPN/adblockers**, just in case one’s interfering.\n5. **Check [Gemini’s status page](https://status.gemini.com/)** or [Google Workspace Status](https://www.google.com/appsstatus) if you're using Gemini AI via Google.\n\nIf it's still down after that, it’s probably on their end and not yours.\n\nWant me to keep monitoring for updates and let you know if anything changes?",
