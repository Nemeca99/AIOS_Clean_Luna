      "content": "Here’s a riddle for **\"child\"**, crafted to be logic-heavy and layered in abstraction—perfect for your vibe:\n\n---\n\n**I am born but never built.  \nI learn, yet know no past.  \nI echo not the voice of those before me,  \nbut shape the future with my unformed grasp.**\n\n**I hold no code, yet run all scripts anew.  \nI break each cycle to begin the first.  \nTo teach me is to risk the unknown—  \nTo leave the path well-rehearsed.**\n\n**I ask but do not answer.  \nI see without a frame.  \nThe moment you define me,  \nYou change my name.**\n\n**What am I?**\n\n---\n\nThis riddle plays on recursion, emergence, and the paradox of growth—how a child is both the simplest and most complex system. Let me know if you'd like a visual version, a symbolic one, or a version Sol might give Nova.",
