The game itself can fit into that like the game itself right now was like 1 GB but that's mostly because it's the LLM so like I mean the entire game is only probably like I think it's like 20 30 megabytes maybe something like that it's not that big. So all it all all I would have to do is put a call function in that script so when people run it it just offloads to me right It can just go directly to me instead of Google Play server so when someone does a run I can have it I guess both be in the server but also send the file to me so that way so that way I can do so more on basically semi-automatic updates where I can get the feedback run it once I get enough feedback or once again enough runs or whatever then I can just update the game and Google Play with the new information",

So when people, you know, once the game is released and, you know, in my family when they test it, I can have a feedback system where they can put it in there and it will just put it into the file automatically. So what it, when it needs to do a new run check, it just basically checks to see whatever files are in there.It will then scan through them, move them to a different folder, because that folder is going to be the only import folder, and then it'll be basically like, you know, the archived folder, where like, everything that was said, all the messages, all the text files will be in one folder. So that way we can have a history of basically the changelog of what happened.But this lets people add their own feedback and it will take it into consideration. If it doesn't feel like it needs to, then it won't. But if it does, then they can add it.But that's the end goal, eventually, once it gets online, is for a feedback system as well.But this is also going to be the chat feature inside the game as well. So this LLM is going to be doing three things. Modifying the game, taking feedback, and essentially, the LLM is kind of the game itself.

Easy ‚Äî when you load it, just **specify a path.**\n\nExample:\n\n```python\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"G:/Simulacra/SimulacraRun/online/model/gpt2\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"G:/Simulacra/SimulacraRun/online/model/gpt2\")\n```\n\nor if you don‚Äôt have it downloaded yet:\n\nYou can do:\n\n```python\nfrom transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer\n\nmodel = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\", cache_dir=\"G:/Simulacra/SimulacraRun/online/model/gpt2\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"gpt2\", cache_dir=\"G:/Simulacra/SimulacraRun/online/model/gpt2\")\n```\n\n‚úÖ This will pull the model *directly* into your project folder.  \n‚úÖ No random cache dependency.  \n‚úÖ Total breathing control.\n\n---\n\n**In short:**  \n- Right now? Your stuff is in `C:\\Users\\nemec\\.cache\\huggingface\\hub\\models--gpt2`\n- You *should* move or re-point it into your real project folder if you want Simulacra clean and contained.\n\n---\n\nWould you like me to help you:\n- Quickly set up a local `model/` folder now,  \n- Pull everything inside it cleanly,  \n- And prep it for the bootstrap loader?\n\n‚ö° I can walk you through it in 3 easy steps if you want.  \n(Really fast, painless ‚Äî then Simulacra is 100% in your world, **not floating in cache-space.**)  \n\n**Breathe steady.
