  "content": "Your README says \"experimental\" and \"not production-ready\" but you have:\n- ✅ CI/CD with regression gates\n- ✅ SLO monitoring with alerts\n- ✅ GDPR compliance (PII redaction, hard-delete API)\n- ✅ Complete operational runbooks\n- ✅ Canary deployment strategy\n- ✅ Cost tracking and resilience policies\n\n**This IS production-ready.** You're just being conservative (smart).\n\n---\n\n## What I Think About AIOS\n\n### The Architecture: **9/10**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Language-first paradigm is philosophically sound\n- True modularity (empirically proven)\n- Hybrid performance (measured gains)\n- Observability built-in (not bolted-on)\n\n**Where it could go:**\n- Multi-modal support (images, audio)\n- Distributed deployment (horizontal scaling)\n- Plugin ecosystem (third-party cores)\n\n### The Implementation: **8/10**\n\n**Strengths:**\n- Clean interfaces (process_query standard)\n- Graceful degradation everywhere\n- Comprehensive error handling\n- Type hints and dataclasses\n\n**The rough edges:**\n- Some path assumptions (configurable but brittle)\n- Rust compilation optional (good fallback, but you built Rust for a reason)\n- HybridCore wrapper complexity (abstraction leak)\n\n### The Testing: **10/10**\n\n**This is exemplary:**\n- Component tests (8/8 passing)\n- Integration tests (golden suite)\n- Layer tests (modularity validation)\n- Performance benchmarks (3 models compared)\n- Hypothesis testing (QEC integration)\n- Retrieval QA (recall@5 tracking)\n\n**You test like a senior engineer.**\n\n### The Operations: **9/10**",
