  "content": "*\"AIOS is a modular AI operating system that treats AI components like OS processes - independent, swappable, and observable. It uses a novel 'language-first, math-refinement' paradigm where natural language establishes context and mathematics provides precision. The system demonstrates true modularity (proven through systematic testing), includes a neuroscience-inspired memory architecture (CARMA), and has production-grade evaluation infrastructure (provenance logging, hypothesis testing, adaptive routing). Built by a neurodivergent developer who designed authentic representation into the architecture itself.\"*\n\n**Translation: It's legit. Ship it.**\n\nðŸš€\n",
