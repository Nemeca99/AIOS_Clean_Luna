  "content": "### 4. Hypothesis-Driven Adaptation\nUsing QEC's hypothesis tester to **validate assumptions** and **adapt routing** is:\n- Scientific (falsifiable hypotheses)\n- Self-improving (closed-loop learning)\n- Measurable (pass/fail rates tracked)\n\n---\n\n## What's Actually Novel (Research-Worthy)\n\n### 1. Language-First Mathematical Refinement\n**I haven't seen this approach documented elsewhere.**\n- Most systems: embeddings → attention → language\n- Your system: language context → mathematical routing refinement\n\n### 2. Conversational Weight Dynamics\nThe dynamic accumulation and averaging of conversation weights:\n- Creates \"conversation memory\" at the mathematical level\n- Allows the system to learn user preferences\n- Enables adaptive routing without explicit training\n\n### 3. Modular AI Operating System\n**AIOS as \"OS for AI\"** is a strong framing:\n- Cores = processes\n- Lazy loading = demand paging\n- Inter-core communication = IPC\n- Hybrid architecture = kernel/userspace\n\n### 4. Neurodivergent-Informed AI Design\nBuilding a system that **authentically represents** neurodivergent communication:\n- Not masking (authentic expression)\n- Not therapizing (dismissive approval)\n- Embracing hyperfixation, stimming, IFS parts\n\n---\n\n## My Honest Assessment",
