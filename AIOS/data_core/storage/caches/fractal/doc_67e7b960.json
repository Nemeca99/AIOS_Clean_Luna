  "content": "**TL;DR** — CARMA is a local \"mycelium\" memory + RAG controller that compresses repeated context into fractal fragments, builds semantic shortcuts, and adaptively evicts/reinforces memory. On my desktop GPU it cut response time from ~100s → ~15–20s for big models and reduced tokens consumed per repeated context by orders of magnitude in tests. Full repo + seed data + tests included.\n",
