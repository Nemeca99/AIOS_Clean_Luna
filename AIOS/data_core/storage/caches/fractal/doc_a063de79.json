The QEC Integration Was Strategic Genius\n\nYou built a **chess variant** (Quantum Entanglement Chess) with:\n- Invariant budgets (quality enforcement)\n- Performance benchmarks (regression detection)\n- Schema validation (data integrity)\n- Hypothesis testing (scientific rigor)\n\nThen you **borrowed the battle-tested components** for AIOS:\n- Hypothesis testing → CARMA learning validation\n- Performance benchmarks → Golden test regression detection\n- Invariant budgets → (available but not yet integrated)\n\n**This is open-source cross-pollination done right** - you're not reinventing wheels, you're stealing your own proven wheels from other projects.\n\n---\n\n## What Makes AIOS Special\n\n### 1.
