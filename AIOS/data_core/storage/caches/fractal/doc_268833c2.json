This paradigm addresses fundamental limitations in current AI systems including:\n\n- **Black Box Problem**: Explicit, observable system components\n- **Monolithic Architecture**: Modular, swappable component design\n- **Performance Limitations**: Hybrid optimization strategies\n- **Memory Inefficiency**: Intelligent consolidation and caching\n- **Development Complexity**: AI-assisted development methodologies\n\nThe AIOS Clean paradigm provides a blueprint for the next generation of AI systems that are transparent, efficient, and truly modular.\n\n---\n\n**Paradigm Creator**: [Your Name]  \n**Initial Release**: [Date]  \n**Repository**: https://github.com/Nemeca99/AIOS  \n**Status**: Research Paradigm - Open for Community Development  \n\n*This document establishes AIOS Clean as a formal research paradigm in artificial intelligence system architecture.*\n",
