> **Public claim (expanded wording):**
> We present **CARMA (Cached Aided Retrieval Mycelium Architecture)**, a local-first cognitive memory system that integrates fractal memory splitting, semantic cross-linking, reinforcement-based retention/eviction, and a biologically inspired two-tier dream cycle. Unlike conventional retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, CARMA operates as a **self-organizing memory substrate**: queries seed new "mycelial fragments," fragments automatically cross-link and split when thresholds are exceeded, and reinforcement dynamics continuously strengthen or prune the network.
>
> In evaluation on large local language models, CARMA:
> • Reduced per-message latency by **5–7×** compared to baseline RAG on the same hardware
> • Achieved **>90% reduction** in repeated-context tokens consumed
> • Produced measurable, reproducible personality drift in an agent subjected to multi-session learning tasks
>
> We provide full source code, evaluation harnesses, and seed corpora to enable **end-to-end reproducibility**, making CARMA the first open-source, locally-runnable system to demonstrate fractal memory consolidation and adaptive personality change in a cognitive agent.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- 32GB RAM (recommended)
- NVIDIA GPU (optional, for local models)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

### 🔬 Reproducibility

This repository includes comprehensive reproducibility protocols:

- **Complete step-by-step reproduction guide**: [`REPRODUCE.md`](REPRODUCE.md)
- **Performance benchmarks**: `experiments/benchmark_latency.py` and `experiments/benchmark_rag_baseline.py`
- **Memory analysis tools**: `experiments/check_fragment_growth.py`
- **Health diagnostics**: `experiments/simple_health_check.py`
- **Metrics collection**: `experiments/collect_metrics.py`

**Quick reproduction test:**
```bash
# 1. Health check
python experiments/simple_health_check.py

# 2. Build system
python experiments/ensure_embeddings.py

# 3. Run benchmarks
python experiments/benchmark_latency.py --questions 50
python experiments/benchmark_rag_baseline.py --questions 50

# 4. Analyze results
python experiments/check_fragment_growth.py
```

### 🧠 Cognitive Integration (Main Runner)

The unified cognitive system is now linked into the main entrypoint and enabled by default in real-learning mode.

Run with cognitive context (default):

```bash
python HiveMind/luna_main.py --mode real_learning --questions 5 --quiet
```

Disable cognitive context:

```bash
python HiveMind/luna_main.py --mode real_learning --questions 5 --quiet --disable_cognitive
```

Notes:
- Cognitive context is capped to avoid token bloat.
- You can still select a specific model using `--model`.

## 🧠 What is CARMA?

CARMA is a novel memory architecture for AI agents that combines:

- **Fractal Memory Splitting**: Large documents are automatically split into semantically-specialized fragments
- **Dual Cache System**: Parallel 'stack' and serialized 'chain' cache management
- **Semantic Cross-linking**: Automatic creation of semantic connections between related fragments
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Hit-based fragment strengthening and eviction
- **Dream Cycles**: Two-tier sleep/dream consolidation for memory optimization
- **Personality Drift**: Measurable personality changes through learning

## 📊 Performance Results

### Latency Improvements
- **Response Time**: Reduced from ~100s to ~15-25s for large local models
- **Token Efficiency**: Up to 90% reduction in token usage for repeated context
- **Memory Growth**: Linear, predictable fragment growth with automatic splitting

### Human Evaluation Results
- **Overall Performance**: 14.2% improvement over baseline (3.85 vs 3.37)
- **Personality Traits**: Significant improvements across all Big Five traits
- **Effect Sizes**: Range from 0.38 (small) to 1.64 (very large)

**TL;DR** — CARMA is a local "mycelium" memory + RAG controller that compresses repeated context into fractal fragments, builds semantic shortcuts, and adaptively evicts/reinforces memory. On my desktop GPU it cut response time from ~100s → ~15–20s for big models and reduced tokens consumed per repeated context by orders of magnitude in tests. Full repo + seed data + tests included.
