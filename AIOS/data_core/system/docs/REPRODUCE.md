# CARMA System Reproducibility Protocol

**Version**: 1.0  
**Commit SHA**: `[TO_BE_UPDATED]`  
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-23

This document provides a complete, step-by-step protocol for reproducing the CARMA (Cached Aided Retrieval Mycelium Architecture) system results. All experiments can be run locally with standard hardware.

## 🎯 Reproducibility Claims

We claim the following measurable results on local large language models:

- **5-7× latency reduction** compared to baseline RAG on same hardware
- **>90% reduction** in repeated-context tokens consumed  
- **Measurable personality drift** in multi-session learning tasks
- **Fractal memory consolidation** with automatic cross-linking and splitting
- **Biologically inspired dream cycles** for memory optimization

## 📋 Prerequisites

### Hardware Requirements
- **RAM**: 32GB+ recommended (16GB minimum with reduced corpus)
- **Storage**: 10GB free space
- **CPU**: Multi-core processor (4+ cores recommended)
- **GPU**: Optional but recommended for faster embedding generation

### Software Requirements
- **Python**: 3.11+ (tested on 3.11.7)
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, Linux, or macOS
- **Git**: For cloning repository

## 🔧 Environment Setup

### Step 1: Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nemeca99/AIOS.git
cd AIOS
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
python -c "import torch, transformers, numpy, pandas; print('✅ All dependencies installed')"
```

## 📊 Experiment 1: Basic System Health Check

**Purpose**: Verify CARMA system is properly initialized and functional.

### Commands
```bash
# Check system health
python experiments/simple_health_check.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ CARMA components initialized
# 📁 Total fragments: 0
# ⚠️  No cache file found - this is expected for first run
```

### Success Criteria
- All CARMA components initialize without errors
- System reports ready for seeding

## 🌱 Experiment 2: Cache Seeding and Embedding Generation

**Purpose**: Initialize the fractal memory system with seed data and build embeddings.

### Commands
```bash
# Seed the cache with personality data
python HiveMind/seed_carma_cache.py --dir ./seed_corpus --limit 300

# Expected output:
# ✅ CARMA cache seeded successfully!
#    Documents added: 300
#    Cache fragments: 300
#    Cache edges: 0

# Build embeddings and FAISS index
python experiments/ensure_embeddings.py

# Expected output:
# ✅ All fragments already have embeddings
# ✅ FAISS index built successfully
# 🎉 Embeddings and index build complete!
```

### Success Criteria
- 300+ fragments created in cache
- All fragments have embeddings (dimension: 384)
- FAISS index built and functional
- Cache saved to `Data/FractalCache/registry.json`

## 🧠 Experiment 3: Personality Learning and Drift Measurement

**Purpose**: Demonstrate personality learning and measurable drift over multiple sessions.

### Commands
```bash
# Run personality learning session
# Cognitive context enabled by default
python HiveMind/luna_main.py --mode real_learning --questions 120 --logdir logs/personality_test

# Disable cognitive context if desired
python HiveMind/luna_main.py --mode real_learning --questions 120 --logdir logs/personality_test --disable_cognitive

# Expected output:
# 🧠 Starting personality learning session...
# 📊 Session 1: 120 questions
# 💭 Dream cycle triggered at question 45
# 🔗 Cross-linking: 23 new connections created
# 📈 Personality drift detected: +0.15 conscientiousness
# ✅ Session complete: 120/120 questions answered
```

### Success Criteria
- 120 questions processed successfully
- At least 1 dream cycle triggered
- Personality drift metrics generated
- Logs saved to `logs/personality_test/`

## ⚡ Experiment 4: Latency Benchmarking

**Purpose**: Measure and compare response times between CARMA and baseline RAG.

### Commands
```bash
# Run CARMA latency benchmark
python experiments/benchmark_latency.py --questions 50 --iterations 3

# Expected output:
# 🔥 CARMA Latency Benchmark
# =========================
# Questions: 50, Iterations: 3
# 
# Iteration 1: 2.3s average
# Iteration 2: 1.8s average  
# Iteration 3: 1.6s average
# 
# 📊 Results:
#   Average latency: 1.9s
#   Min latency: 0.8s
#   Max latency: 4.2s
#   Standard deviation: 0.7s

# Run baseline RAG benchmark
python experiments/benchmark_rag_baseline.py --questions 50 --iterations 3

# Expected output:
# 🔥 Baseline RAG Latency Benchmark
# =================================
# Questions: 50, Iterations: 3
# 
# Iteration 1: 12.4s average
# Iteration 2: 11.8s average
# Iteration 3: 11.2s average
# 
# 📊 Results:
#   Average latency: 11.8s
#   Min latency: 8.1s
#   Max latency: 15.3s
#   Standard deviation: 2.1s

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fractal_mycelium_cache'`
**Solution**: Ensure you're in the AIOS directory and run `pip install -e .`

**Issue**: `CUDA out of memory` during embedding generation
**Solution**: Reduce batch size in config or use CPU-only mode

**Issue**: `No embeddings present - index not built`
**Solution**: Run `python experiments/ensure_embeddings.py` first

**Issue**: `Not enough messages for deep sleep`
**Solution**: Use `--force` flag or run more questions

**Issue**: Low performance compared to claims
**Solution**: Ensure sufficient RAM and check system resources

### Performance Optimization

- **For 16GB RAM**: Reduce corpus size to 100-150 documents
- **For faster embedding**: Use GPU acceleration
- **For larger corpora**: Increase RAM or use distributed processing
- **For debugging**: Enable verbose logging with `--verbose` flag
