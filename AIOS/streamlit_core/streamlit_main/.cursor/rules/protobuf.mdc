# Protobuf

Protobuf messages are used for communication between the Streamlit backend and frontend via WebSocket connections.

**Note**: Messages are "released" once shipped in any Streamlit version.

## Protobuf Compatibility

Always keep protobuf messages backwards compatible. New versions must work with older Streamlit versions.

**Incompatible changes to avoid:**

- Removing a field → Add `// DEPRECATED` comment and mark `[deprecated=true]`
- Renaming a field → Deprecate old field, add new field with next available number
- Changing field numbers → Keep all existing numbers unchanged
- Adding/removing `optional` → Deprecate and create new field
- Changing field types incompatibly → Use new field with compatible type

**Compatible changes (safe to make):**

- Adding new optional fields
- Adding comments
- Marking fields as deprecated
- Modifying/removing unreleased fields

## Compile Protobuf

Changes requiring compilation:

- Adding a field
- **Unreleased messages only:** Modifying/removing fields

Changes not requiring compilation:

- Comments and `[deprecated=true]` notation

Run this command to recompile the protobufs:

```bash
make protobuf
```

## Important Files

- `ForwardMsg.proto`: Root message used to send information from the server to the frontend/browser.
- `BackMsg.proto`: Root message sent from the browser to the server, e.g. script rerun requests.
- `NewSession.proto`: First message that is sent to the browser on every rerun.
- `Block.proto`: Contains all block types. A block is a layout container for elements (e.g. columns, tabs, popovers, etc.).
- `Element.proto`: Contains all element types. An element is a UI component.
