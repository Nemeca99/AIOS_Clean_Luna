Train Mechanical Base Model (Age 0)
Creates "dumb but fluent" foundation - syntax without semantics

This creates Luna's starting brain:
- Can form grammatically correct sentences
- Knows how words fit together
- Has ZERO understanding of meaning
- Like a very drunk woman - sounds coherent but meaningless

    Create Age 0 mechanical base model.
    
    Steps:
    1. Load smallest Llama base (1B or 3B)
    2. Strip out pre-training (if possible)
    3. Train ONLY on grammar/syntax patterns
    4. Save as luna_age_0_mechanical.gguf
    
    Training Data:
    - curriculum/phase_0_mechanical.json (500 syntax examples)
    - NO semantic content
    - NO world knowledge
    - NO reasoning patterns
    
    Result:
    - Model can form coherent sentences
    - Has NO understanding of what they mean
    - Sounds smart, is actually dumb
    - Perfect "tabula rasa" starting point
