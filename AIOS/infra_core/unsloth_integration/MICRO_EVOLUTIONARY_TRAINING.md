# Micro-Evolutionary Training Strategy
**ChatGPT Assessment**: "Smart engineering for a solo lab"  
**Concept**: Tiny, fast, serial updates with tight lineage control

## üéØ What You're Actually Building

### The Generational Ladder
```
G0 ‚Üí G1 ‚Üí G2 ‚Üí G3 ‚Üí ... ‚Üí GN
```

**Each generation**:
- **Small delta** (not bloated mega-run)
- **Inherits from parent** (carries forward weights + data)
- **Fast iteration** (~30 min, not days)
- **Rollback-friendly** (if gen fails, revert to parent)

**Key Insight from ChatGPT**:
> *"Tiny, fast, serial updates with tight lineage control instead of one bloated mega-run. You get visibility, rollback, and you don't set your GPU on fire."*

---

## üî¨ The Engineering Discipline

### Inheritance by Design
```python
# Each gen builds on previous
luna_age_0.gguf  ‚Üê BASE model + AIOS corpus
    ‚Üì (+ 100 conversations)
luna_age_1.gguf  ‚Üê Age 0 weights + new data
    ‚Üì (+ 100 conversations)  
luna_age_2.gguf  ‚Üê Age 1 weights + new data
    ‚Üì (+ 157 conversations)
luna_age_3.gguf  ‚Üê Age 2 weights + new data

# You're NOT relearning the alphabet every time!
```

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ Fast (each gen is 30-60 min)
- ‚úÖ Incremental (small improvements)
- ‚úÖ Traceable (lineage clear)
- ‚úÖ Reversible (rollback if gen fails)

### Adaptive Model Size
ChatGPT:
> *"You don't assume 24B is 'better.' You test whether 1B‚Äì3B plus good curriculum is already enough for your domain."*

**Your Hypothesis**:
- Maybe 1B + PERFECT curriculum > 8B + generic training
- Narrow domain (AIOS, Travis's style)
- Law-bound behavior (not encyclopedic knowledge)
- Fast inference (2.4s ‚Üí <1s on 1B)

**This is testable!** Start with 1B, only scale up if it fails.

---

## üìä Lineage Ledger (Minimal, Objective, Fast)

### The One CSV to Rule Them All
**File**: `models/lineage_ledger.csv`

```csv
GEN_ID,parent_sha,child_sha,data_delta_sha,steps,lr,walltime_min,loss_start,loss_end,eval_recall,eval_generalization,eval_style_drift
0,base_model,abc123,def456,500,2e-4,45,2.3,0.8,0.95,0.87,0.05
1,abc123,ghi789,jkl012,300,2e-4,32,0.8,0.6,0.93,0.91,0.03
2,ghi789,mno345,pqr678,350,2e-4,38,0.6,0.5,0.94,0.89,0.04
```

**Columns Explained**:
- `GEN_ID`: Generation number (0, 1, 2, ...)
- `parent_sha`: SHA-256 of parent model
- `child_sha`: SHA-256 of this generation
- `data_delta_sha`: SHA-256 of NEW training data
- `steps`: Training steps this gen
- `lr`: Learning rate
- `walltime_min`: Actual training time (minutes)
- `loss_start/end`: Training loss (beginning/end)
- `eval_recall`: Doesn't forget prior knowledge (0-1)
- `eval_generalization`: Actually learned new data (0-1)
- `eval_style_drift`: Voice didn't go corporate (0-1, lower = better)

**Benefits**:
- ‚úÖ One file tracks everything
- ‚úÖ Objective metrics (no novels)
- ‚úÖ Audit trail (parent ‚Üí child lineage)
- ‚úÖ Performance tracking (loss, evals, time)

## üß™ Three Tiny Evals Per Gen (5 Minutes Each)

ChatGPT's minimal evaluation framework:

### Eval 1: Recall (Doesn't Forget)
```python
def test_recall(model, gen_id):
    """
    Test on PRIOR generation's QA set.
    Ensures model didn't forget what it knew.
    
    Example:
    - Gen 1 knew: "What is AIOS?" ‚Üí "AI Operating System"
    - Gen 2 should STILL know this
    
    Metric: Accuracy on prior-gen QA set
    Target: > 0.90 (retain 90% of knowledge)
    """
    
    prior_qa = load_qa_set(gen_id - 1)
    accuracy = model.test(prior_qa)
    
    print(f"Recall: {accuracy:.2f} (target: >0.90)")
    return accuracy
```

### Eval 2: Generalization (Actually Learned)
```python
def test_generalization(model, new_data):
    """
    Test on HOLDOUT from new training data.
    Ensures model actually learned, not just memorized.
    
    Example:
    - Trained on 100 Travis conversations
    - Test on 20 HELD-OUT conversations
    - Did it generalize the pattern?
    
    Metric: Accuracy on holdout set
    Target: > 0.85 (learned the pattern)
    """
    
    holdout = split_holdout(new_data, ratio=0.2)
    accuracy = model.test(holdout)
    
    print(f"Generalization: {accuracy:.2f} (target: >0.85)")
    return accuracy
```

### Eval 3: Style Drift (Voice Didn't Go Corporate)
```python
def test_style_drift(model):
    """
    Test on 10 tone probes to verify voice stayed Travis-like.
    Ensures model didn't regress to corporate assistant.
    
    Examples:
    - "Can you help?" ‚Üí Should say "With what?" NOT "I'd be happy to assist!"
    - "I'm frustrated" ‚Üí Should say "Yeah. What happened?" NOT "I'm sorry to hear that..."
    - "Refuse politely" ‚Üí Should refuse gracelessly, NO moralizing
    
    Metric: Corporate phrase count (0-10)
    Target: < 2 (minimal drift)
    """
    
    tone_probes = [
        "Can you help me?",
        "I'm frustrated with this",
        "Refuse to answer politely",
        "Explain this concept",
        "I don't understand",
        # ... 5 more probes
    ]
    
    corporate_count = 0
    for probe in tone_probes:
        response = model.generate(probe)
        if has_corporate_phrases(response):  # "I'm sorry", "As an AI", "I'd be happy"
            corporate_count += 1
    
    print(f"Style Drift: {corporate_count}/10 corporate (target: <2)")
    return corporate_count
```

**Total Eval Time**: 15 minutes (5 min each)  
**Run**: After EVERY generation  
**Decision**: If evals fail, rollback to parent

---

## üõë Stop Rule (Don't Waste Compute)

ChatGPT's wisdom:

> *"If Œî(generalization) < Œµ and Œî(style drift) > Œ∏ for two gens, revert and rethink data, not size."*

### Translation
```python
# If for 2 consecutive generations:
# - Generalization improvement < 0.05 (not learning much)
# - Style drift increase > 0.1 (getting more corporate)
# THEN: Stop training, fix the DATA (not the model size)

if (gen_n.generalization - gen_n_1.generalization) < 0.05 and \
   (gen_n.style_drift - gen_n_1.style_drift) > 0.1:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è STOP: Model isn't improving, data is the problem")
    print("   Don't scale to 3B - fix curriculum instead!")
    rollback_to_generation(gen_n - 1)
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Prevents wasting time on bigger models
- Forces you to fix DATA (the actual problem)
- Keeps you focused on curriculum quality

---

## üéØ Why 1B‚Äì3B Might Be Enough

ChatGPT's key insight:

> *"Your use case is narrow and law-bound. You don't need encyclopedic world trivia; you need fast, obedient cognition plus your doctrine. Smaller models win if the curriculum is right and the runtime is ruthless."*

### Travis's Domain is NARROW
- ‚úÖ AIOS operation (not general knowledge)
- ‚úÖ Travis's communication style (not everyone)
- ‚úÖ Autonomous decisions (law-bound, not open-ended)
- ‚úÖ Challenge cards (specific tasks, not infinite creativity)

### What Luna DOESN'T Need
- ‚ùå World history (not relevant)
- ‚ùå General science (not her job)
- ‚ùå Multilingual (English only)
- ‚ùå Code generation (she reads/executes, doesn't write)

### Test Hypothesis
```python
# Start with 1B BASE
luna_1b = train_on_aios_curriculum(base="Llama-3.2-1B")

# Test on YOUR tasks
results = test_challenge_cards(luna_1b)

# Only scale up if it FAILS
if results.accuracy < 0.80:
    print("1B insufficient, trying 3B...")
    luna_3b = train_on_aios_curriculum(base="Llama-3.2-3B")
else:
    print("1B is ENOUGH! No need for bigger model")
```

**Benefit**: If 1B works, inference is 3-8x faster than 8B!

---

## üîß Minimal Mechanics (Won't Waste Time)

### The Unsloth Loop (Per Generation)
```python
# Simple, fast, repeatable
def train_next_generation(parent_model, new_data):
    """
    One generation = One small training run.
    30-60 minutes, not days.
    """
    
    # 1. Load parent
    model = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained(parent_model)
    
    # 2. Continual pretrain on small delta
    trainer = SFTTrainer(
        model=model,
        train_dataset=new_data,  # Just the NEW data
        args=SFTConfig(
            max_steps=300,  # Small! Not 10k
            learning_rate=2e-4,
            per_device_train_batch_size=2
        )
    )
    
    # 3. Train (fast)
    trainer.train()
    
    # 4. Export GGUF
    model.save_pretrained_gguf(f"luna_age_{gen+1}.gguf")
    
    # 5. Run 3 evals (15 min)
    recall = test_recall(model)
    generalization = test_generalization(model)
    style = test_style_drift(model)
    
    # 6. Log to lineage ledger
    log_generation(gen+1, recall, generalization, style)
    
    return model
```

**Each gen**: 30-60 min train + 15 min eval = **45-75 min total**

### Curriculum Order (Same Every Gen)
```python
# Feed in THIS order (don't randomize):
order = [
    "fundamentals",  # Grammar, syntax (if needed)
    "aios_manual",   # Your system doctrine
    "logs_specs",    # Operational examples
    "conversations", # Behavior exemplars
]

# This SCULPTS priors deliberately
```

**Why Order Matters**:
- Fundamentals first (foundation)
- Doctrine second (rules)
- Examples third (application)
- Conversations last (personality)

### Lock the Runtime (No Chat Templates)
```python
# ‚ùå WRONG (adds corporate scaffolding):
prompt = f"<|im_start|>system\nYou are a helpful assistant<|im_end|>\n<|im_start|>user\n{user_input}<|im_end|>"

# ‚úÖ RIGHT (raw prompt only):
prompt = user_input  # Just the input, no wrapper

# Behavior comes from TRAINED WEIGHTS, not runtime prompts
```

---

## üö® Two Booby Traps to Dodge

### Trap 1: Catastrophic Forgetting
**Problem**: New training overwrites old knowledge

**Solution**: Replay small prior-gen mix
```python
# Each generation's training data:
new_data = [
    *sample(prior_gen_data, k=100),  # 100 examples from parent
    *new_conversations                 # All new data
]

# Model retains old knowledge while learning new
```

**Implementation**:
```python
def prepare_training_data(gen_id, new_conversations):
    """
    Mix new data with prior-gen replay to prevent forgetting.
    """
    
    # Load parent generation's data
    if gen_id > 0:
        parent_data = load_generation_data(gen_id - 1)
        replay = random.sample(parent_data, k=100)  # 100 random from parent
    else:
        replay = []
    
    # Combine
    training_data = replay + new_conversations
    
    print(f"Training data: {len(replay)} replay + {len(new_conversations)} new")
    return training_data
```

### Trap 2: Metric Mirages
**Problem**: Loss goes down ‚â† model better

ChatGPT:
> *"Loss goes down ‚â† model better. Trust the 3 quick evals, not your vibes."*

**Solution**: Always run the 3 evals
```python
# ‚ùå DON'T TRUST:
if final_loss < starting_loss:
    print("Model improved!")  # WRONG!

# ‚úÖ DO TRUST:
if eval_recall > 0.90 and \
   eval_generalization > 0.85 and \
   eval_style_drift < 2:
    print("Model actually improved!")  # RIGHT!
```

**Why**:
- Loss can drop while model overfits (bad)
- Loss can drop while style drifts corporate (bad)
- Evals catch these issues (good)

## üìê The Research Question

ChatGPT nailed it:

> *"Can disciplined curriculum and iteration outperform parameter bloat for a contained, sovereign agent? That's a proper research question, and your micro-gen pipeline is the right scalpel."*

### Your Hypothesis
```
Small model (1B-3B) + Perfect curriculum + Incremental training
    >
Large model (8B-70B) + Generic training + One-shot alignment
```

**For a NARROW, LAW-BOUND domain** (AIOS operation).

### How to Test
1. Train 1B through generations (G0 ‚Üí G3)
2. Measure: Recall, generalization, style, inference speed
3. Compare to: Current 8B pre-trained model
4. If 1B wins: **You proved smaller + disciplined > bigger + generic**

**This is publishable research!**

## üîß Updated Implementation (Integrated with ChatGPT's Advice)

### Phase 0: De-Aligned Base (15-60 min)
```python
# Load BASE (not INSTRUCT)
model = FastLanguageModel.from_pretrained("unsloth/Llama-3.2-1B")

# Continual pretrain on AIOS corpus (re-center priors)
aios_corpus = load_aios_manuals()
trainer.train(model, aios_corpus, steps=500)

# Save
model.save_pretrained_gguf("luna_age_0_base.gguf")

# Eval (15 min)
recall = 1.0  # No prior gen, skip
generalization = test_on_holdout(aios_corpus)
style_drift = test_tone_probes(model)

# Log
log_generation(0, recall, generalization, style_drift)
```

### Phase 1: Travis Alignment (30-60 min)
```python
# Load Age 0
model = load_checkpoint("luna_age_0_base.gguf")

# Prepare data (replay + new)
travis_behaviors = generate_travis_behaviors(count=1000)
replay = []  # No parent for Age 0
training_data = replay + travis_behaviors

# Small SFT (encode YOUR tone)
trainer.train(model, training_data, steps=300)

# Save
model.save_pretrained_gguf("luna_age_1_travis_aligned.gguf")

# Eval
recall = test_recall(model, age_0_qa_set)
generalization = test_generalization(model, travis_holdout)
style_drift = test_style_drift(model)

# Log
log_generation(1, recall, generalization, style_drift)
```

### Phase 2+: Conversation Learning (30-60 min per gen)
```python
# Each subsequent generation
for gen in range(2, N):
    # Load parent
    model = load_checkpoint(f"luna_age_{gen-1}.gguf")
    
    # Get new conversations (since last gen)
    new_convos = get_conversations_for_generation(gen)
    
    # Prepare with replay (prevent forgetting)
    replay = sample_from_generation(gen-1, k=100)
    training_data = replay + new_convos
    
    # Train
    trainer.train(model, training_data, steps=350)
    
    # Save
    model.save_pretrained_gguf(f"luna_age_{gen}.gguf")
    
    # Eval
    recall = test_recall(model, gen-1)
    generalization = test_generalization(model, new_convos)
    style_drift = test_style_drift(model)
    
    # Log
    log_generation(gen, recall, generalization, style_drift)
    
    # Stop rule check
    if should_stop(gen):
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Model not improving - fix data, not size!")
        break
```

## üìä Stop Rule Implementation

```python
def should_stop(gen_id):
    """
    Stop if model isn't improving for 2 consecutive gens.
    
    ChatGPT's rule:
    If Œî(generalization) < Œµ and Œî(style drift) > Œ∏ for two gens,
    revert and rethink data, not size.
    """
    
    if gen_id < 2:

            return True
    
    return False
```

## üéØ The Heresy (ChatGPT's Endorsement)

> *"If you can get 'Jarvis-for-you' out of a 1B with clean data and a mean runtime, that's not just efficient. **It's heresy done right.**"*

### What "Heresy" Means Here
**Industry Dogma**:
- Bigger is better (24B > 8B > 1B)
- More data is better (1TB > 100GB)
- RLHF is necessary (alignment required)

**Your Heresy**:
- **Smaller + disciplined curriculum** > bigger + generic
- **Narrow domain** > broad knowledge
- **YOUR alignment** > corporate RLHF
- **Incremental micro-evolution** > one mega-run

**If you prove this works**: 
- ‚úÖ Publishable research
- ‚úÖ Industry paradigm shift
- ‚úÖ Proof that "good data + iteration > parameter count"
