## 2025-06-16: Enhanced Text Cleaning

### Major Changes
- **Improved Text Cleaning**: Significantly enhanced the `clean_text` function with:
  - Better handling of quoted text (preserves dialogue formatting while fixing detokenization)

  - More robust quotation mark handling for both dialogue and regular quotes
  - All test cases now pass

### Benefits

- Proper handling of URLs and technical content
- Improved dialogue readability

## 2025-06-16: Pipeline Refactoring and Text Cleaning Enhancements

### Major Changes
- **External Configuration**: Refactored all personality data (fragments, styles, blends) to be loaded from `personality/fragment_profiles_and_blends.json` instead of being hardcoded.
- **Fixed Fusion Logic**: Enhanced `dynamic_fusion` to always return a valid fusion with better fallback mechanisms.
- **Advanced Text Cleaning**: Major improvements to detokenization with new `clean_text` function:
  - Fixed spaces before/after punctuation
  - Properly handles contractions (don't, I'll, etc.)
  - Preserves URLs and email addresses
